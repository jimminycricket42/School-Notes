# Experiment Design and Scientific Method
When talking about the *scientific method*, we generally look at certain aspects:
1. Observation
2. Question/Aim
3. Hypothesis
4. Variables
5. method
6. results
7. control

## Observation
All experiments start with an observation: Something has happened and the scientist wants to know why
- [I] **Eg**. Isaac Newton saw an apple fall, and through the scientific method he figured out that gravity exists. 

## Question/Aim
The observation can lead to many questions being asked.
For instance, based off of the "plants grow" example from the previous question, do plants need sunlight?
This can also be seen as *the aim*.

## A hypothesis
A hypothesis is a statement that attempts to predict the outcome to the question asked.

For instance, plants need light to grow.

-   It must be a statement.
-   It must make a prediction that can be proved as right or wrong.
-   It must mention both the [[#Independent Variable]] and [[#Dependant Variable]]
-   Do not use personal pronouns

## Variables
There are three kinds of variables, dependant, independent, and controlled.

### Dependant Variable
The results of the experiment, and is measured during the experiment. ^dependant-variable

### Independent Variable
This is the variable responsible for the change in the dependant variable. It is the only variable that you change during the experiment. ^independant-variable

### Controlled variables
The factors in an experiment that must be kept constant to make the experiment fair. You must list both the name of the controlled variable and how you controlled them.

## Method
This is how you conduct your experiment. It should be in a point-by-point form that is clear and understandable, mentions how you control your variables, and includes the dependant variable and independent variable. It should be easily repeatable, and should include a list of apparatus near the beginning of the method. 

## Results
Results are the outcomes of the experiment, often recorded in a table or graph. See graph and table rules. The final piece is the conclusion. It explains the results and should show evidence from the results, refer back to the hypothesis (was it correct or not), and should use some theory to explain the results. 

## Control
All experiments should have a control so that the results obtained from the experiment an be compared to something where the result of the control is known. Controls do not make a test fair or accurate, but rather allows you to ensure your results make sense.
