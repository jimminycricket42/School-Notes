# Kinetic Molecular Theory
Kinetic Molecular theory is a way of classifying matter. It states that matter exists as solids, liquids, gasses and solutions. The particles that make up these substances are held together by *intermolecular-forces*. ^blurb

> When studying pollen grains in water, Robert brown noticed that the pollen grains moved erratically, seeming to ‘bump’ into the water particles. This random movement was named into Brownian motion, and was strong evidence that objects were made up of small particles in constant motion.

The Kinetic molecular theory follows the ideas that all materials are made of tiny particles that are constantly moving. This movement is brought about by [[Kinetic Energy]] and intermolecular-forces between the particles. 

- Kinetic energy is what causes the particles to move. 
- Intermolecular forces are what prevent the particles from moving apart. 

## Phases of matter
Materials change states when the kinetic energy overcomes the intermolecular forces. 

- Solids have less kinetic energy and high intermolecular forces, causing the particles to be close together
- Liquids have kinetic energy and weak intermolecular forces, allowing the particles to move freely while still being connected by the intermolecular forces. 
- Gasses have much kinetic energy and have completely overcome their intermolecular forces, allowing them to move freely and fill the space they are given. 

These properties also link to the properties of each material’s shape and volume. 

- Solids retain their shape and volume at all times
- Liquids retain their volume, but not their shape. They will take on the shape of the container. 
- Gasses retain neither their volume of shape. They will take on the shape and the volume of their container. 

To summarize:

| Phase  | Kinetic Energy | Intermolecular forces | Shape | Volume | Arrangement |
| ------ | -------------- | --------------------- | ----- | ------ | ----------- |
| Solid  | Low            | High                  | Fixed | Fixed  | Regular     |
| Liquid | Moderate       | Moderate              | Fluid | fixed  | Irregular   |
| Gas    | High           | None                  | Fluid | Fluid  | Irregular; far apart            |

## Factors that affect the phase of matter
We look at:
- Temperature

### Temperature
Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of an atom. The higher the temperature, the faster the particles move. 

Temperature can induce phase changes when the temperature increases past the materials [[boiling point]] or [[Melting Point]]. There are multiple changes of phase that occur during heating or cooling, such as melting, evaporation, condensation, freezing, deposition, and sublimation.

> Where the phase change graph is flat, there is no change in temperature because all the extra energy is going towards breaking the intermolecular forces between the atoms.
