# Bond Length
Bond length is the distance between the nuclei of two [[Bonding|bonded]] atoms. Bond length is dependent on the [[Bond Energy]], as it is a result of the electrostatic forces between atoms. ^blurb

## Bond length during Bonding
Bond length is the distance between atoms that are bonding. This affects the [[Bond Energy]] during bond formation. 

In a system with two atoms, potential energy is *taken to be zero when the atoms are far apart*. As they approach the potential energy is converted to electrostatic force (kinetic energy) as *they begin to attract one-another*. At a certain *distance, they become stable*, and the potential energy is *at itâ€™s minimum*. Here, a chemical bond forms and the attractive and repulsive [[Electrostatics|Electrostatic forces]] are equal.

Bond length also decreases as the amount of bonds that have formed increases. This is because multiple shared electron pairs results in a higher electrostatic force, pulling the nuclei closer together.
