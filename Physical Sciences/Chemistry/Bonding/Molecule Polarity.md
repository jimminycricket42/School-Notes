# Molecule Polarity
[[Polarization]] is the movement of charges within an object to create a more-negatively charged side and a more-positively charged side. Molecules’ polarity is dependent on the [[Bond Polarity]] within the molecule. It helps determine the [[Molecular Shapes]], as well as what type of bond forms within a molecule. ^blurb

## Determining Molecular Polarity
A molecule is polar if there is a net *dipole moment* within in. Dipole moment is the measure of [[Bond Polarity]], so, we can say the molecular polarity is the net bond polarity. If one side of the molecule is more negative than another, then we know that the molecule is polar. 

> [!summary] Working out Molecular Polarity
> 1. Draw a diagram of the bonded molecule. [[Lewis diagrams]] are generally good for this. 
> 2. Determine the [[Bond Polarity|polarity of each bond]]. Draw them onto the diagram.
> 3. Check the sum of the dipole-moment’s of each bond
>	- If the sum of the dipole-moment’s is 0, then the molecule is non-polar. 
>	- If the sum of the dipole moment is not 0, then the molecule is polar.
>		- If the sum of the dipole moment is 0 and the molecule is symmetrical, then the molecule is polar.
>		- If the sum of the dipole moment is 0 and the molecule is not symmetrical, then the molecule is polar covalent.

## Solubility of Molecules Based on Polarity
The polarity of substances affects their [[Solubility]]. *Polar substances are soluble in polar solvents, and non-polar substances dissolve in non-polar solvents*. This is why fat does not dissolve in water, but sugars do. 

Water ($\ce{H2O}$) is a common polar solvent
Carbon tetrachloride ($\ce{CCl4}$) is a common no-polar solvent.
