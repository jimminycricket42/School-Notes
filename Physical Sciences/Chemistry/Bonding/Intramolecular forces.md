# Intramolecular force
  Intramolecular forces are what [[Bonding|bonds]] [[Atoms]] together in a molecule. They are the strong links that determine the chemical properties and the bonding properties of a substance.  ^blurb

^definition

Groups of molecules formed by intramolecular forces are bound together by [[Intermolecular Forces]]. These groups are known as *aggregates* of a substance. 

## Types of Intramolecular Forces
Intramolecular forces can be:
- [[Covalent Bonding]] – Where electrons are shared to form a bond.
- [[Ionic Bonding]] – Where electrons are transferred to form a bond.
- [[Metallic Bonding]] – Where electrons are delocalized to surround positive kernals. 

[[Bond Energy]], [[Bond Energy]], and [[Bond Length]] are properties help us describe the intermolecular forces within an atom. [[Electronegativity]] is the cause of intramolecular forces, and in turn determines many of the bonding properties of an element. 

## Effect of Intramolecular Forces on Molecule Shape
The intramolecular forces within a molecule is what determines the molecular shape. Bonding pairs exert a large amount of electrostatic force, and as such will take up the majority of the space surrounding the atom. Bonded electrons exert very little force, and as such can be squished together, creating angled atoms. 

- The force between *bonding pairs is the weakest repulsive force*
- The force between a *bonding pair and a lone pair is moderately strong*
- The force between *lone pairs is the strongest repulsive force*.
