# Metallic Bonding
#GR10/Q2 #chemistry/bonding/metals 

**Definition**: A metallic bond is an electrostatic force of attraction between a positive *kernal* and a sea of delocalised electrons. 
Metallic bonding only occurs between metals. When metals are bonded, we call their nuclei kernals, as they no longer hold the electrons in orbitals. Instead, the electrons organise themselves as a ‘sea’ of *delocalised* electrons, meaning electrons are flowing freely between metal kernals. This happens because the ratio of kernals to electrons is to high, causing the nuclei to share their electrons with the metals around them. 

## Characteristics of Metal Bonds
| Property                |                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| Electrical Conductivity | Very Conductive  |
| Heat Conductivity       | Very Conductive  |
| Malleable               | Very Malleable   |
| Ductility               | Very Ductile     |
| Structure                | Metallic lattice |
| Electron Structure      | Delocalised                  |

## Alloys
Pure metals are too soft for many uses. An allow is a metal with a mixture of atoms. Alloys are harder than pure metals because the different size atoms means the layers cant easily slide.
