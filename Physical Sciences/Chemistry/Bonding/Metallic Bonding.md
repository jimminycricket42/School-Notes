# Metallic Bonding
Metallic bonding only occurs between metals. When metals are bonded, we call their nuclei kernals, as they no longer hold the electrons in orbitals. Instead, the electrons organize themselves as a ‘sea’ of *delocalized* electrons, meaning electrons are flowing freely between metal kernals. This happens because the ratio of kernals to electrons is to high, causing the nuclei to share their electrons with the metals around them. ^blurb

> [!definition]
 **Metallic Bonding**: An electrostatic force of attraction between a positive *kernal* and a sea of delocalised electrons. 
 

## Characteristics of Metal Bonds
- Very conductive of heat and electricity
- Very malleable
- Very ductile

# Structure of Metallic Bonding
### Metallic Lattice
[[Metallic Bonding]] leads to metallic lattices, where [[Atoms|electrons]] are removed from their cations, forming *kernels* with a ‘sea’ of *delocalised [[Atoms|electrons]]* surrounding them.

### Alloys
Pure metals are too soft for many uses. An allow is a metal with a mixture of atoms. Alloys are harder than pure metals because the different size atoms means the layers cant easily slide.
