# Molecular Shapes
The [[Intermolecular Forces]] of a molecule is affected by it’s [[Molecule Polarity]], as well as it’s molecular shape. To accurately predict these forces, we must understand the shapes that form when elements [[Bonding|bond]] together. ^blurb

According to the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion theory (VSEPR), the shape the atom will take will depend on the amount of bonding pairs attached to the central atom. 
The central atom will be the atom with the highest [[Electronegativity]]. All other electron regions will occur around this atom. 

The position of other electron-regions surrounding the atom will depend on the repulsive forces between electron pairs. The stronger the force, the further apart two things are. The *force between bonding pairs is the weakest repulsive force*, the force between a *bonding pair and a lone pair is moderately strong*, and the force between *lone pairs is the strongest repulsive force*. 

There are 6 shapes that we must know of: 

| Name               | No. Electron Regions | Polarity  |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | --------- |
| Linear             | 2                    | Non-polar |
| Angular            | 4                   | Polar     |
| Trigonal Planar    | 3                    | Non-polar |
| Trigonal Pyramidal | 4                    | Polar     |
| Tetrahedral        | 4                    | Non-polar |
| Octahedral         | 6                    | Non-polar          |
