# Intermolecular Forces
 Intermolecular forces (also called interatomic forces) are what holds together the molecules of a substances, forming groups known as aggregates. They are what determines many of the physical properties of a substance. ^blurb

Intermolecular forces are weaker than [[Intramolecular forces]]. There are several types of intermolecular forces, we study:
- [[#Ion-dipole forces]] – ionic compounds with polar molecules
- [[#Ion-induced dipole]] forces
- [[#Dipole-dipole forces]] – covalent polar compounds
- [[#Hydrogen bonding forces]] –
- [[#London forces]]

## Types of Intermolecular Forces
There are many types of intermolecular forces. We focus mainly on [[Covalent Bonding|covalent molecules]] with smaller atoms and the forces associated with them. This means we are often working with [[Molecule Polarity|polar molecules]], which we call dipoles as a shorthand. 

We look at:
- [[#Ion-dipole forces]]
- [[#Ion-induced dipole forces]]
- [[#Dipole-dipole forces]]
	- [[#Hydrogen bonding forces]]
- [[#Dipole-induced dipole forces]]
- [[#London Forces]]

> [!definition]
> **Dipole**: Molecules that have a more positive and more negative side because of an uneven distribution of electrons.

### Ion-dipole forces
[[Electrons|ions]] and dipoles will orient themselves so that the opposite charges on the ion and the dipole are facing one-another. This is to create the electrostatic force of attraction between the two particles. This reduces the distance between them until they form a stable bond, which is in accordance to [[Electrostatic interactions|Coulombs Law]]. The [[Bond Energy|bond strength]] will be a product of the strength of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the molecules.

### Ion-induced dipole forces
Ion-induced dipole forces are created when an *ion interacts with a non-polar molecule*. Therefore, the atom cannot simply reorient itself. However, the ion still *induces a polarity by attracting the electron cloud to one side of the molecule*. This leaves the opposite side *electron deficient*, and the non-polar molecule will  have a *more-negative* side that will revert to being non-polar if the bond is broken.

### Dipole-dipole forces
Dipole-dipole forces are created by *two polar molecules* that interact, creating a weak force of interaction between them. The *negative end* of one molecule and the *positive end* of another will *orient themselves to face each-other*. This creates a weak *electrostatic force*.

Dipole-dipole interaction can occur between molecules of the same substance or between molecules of two different substances.

#### Hydrogen bonding forces
Hydrogen bonding forces are a special type of dipole-dipole interaction wherein $\ce{H}$ bonds with two $\ce{N, O, F}$ of neighbouring atoms. It forms a stronger dipole-dipole interaction. 

This is because of the *large electronegativity difference* between these atoms. The electrons of the $\ce{H}$ atom is *almost entirely removed from the hydrogen*, and the $\ce{N, O, F}$ gains those electrons, resulting in *strong dipoles*. Additionally, all these *molecules are small* and can become very close together, therefore *increasing [[Bond Energy]]*. 

### Dipole-induced dipole forces
When a polar and a non-polar molecule interact, the polar molecule will attract the ions of the non-polar molecule and distort the electron cloud. This creates a more positively charged and a more negatively charged side, resulting in an electrostatic force of attraction between the two molecules. 

### London Forces
London forces are Induced-dipole-induced-dipole forces. They exist in molecules of *all liquids, solids and gasses*. They are the *result of the constant motion of electrons* occasionally resulting in one slightly more negatively charged side, *causing a momentary dipole* which *induces dipoles in it’s neighbouring molecules*. 

> [!example] Illustrative Example
> Helium is a gas at room temperature, but will turn to a liquid at low temperatures. Normally helium has a perfectly symmetrical electron cloud, but the continuous movement of electron induces a momentary electron which in turn induces a momentary electron in it’s neighbour. 

Large molecules have many electrons, and a large [[Atomic Radius]] which in turn increases the amount electrons can move. That makes it easier to induce electron forces, and creates stronger induced-dipole-induced-dipole forces. 

## Effects of Intermolecular Forces
We discuss:
- Melting and Boiling points
- Density of Materials
- Thermal Expansion
- Thermal Conductivity
- Viscosity

### Melting and Boiling points
The temperature at which a substance undergoes a phase change is a reflection on the strength of the intermolecular forces. This is because, to change phase, the molecules must move away from each other and this takes enough energy to overcome the attractive forces. 

If the intermolecular forces are high, then the boiling and melting point is high. Molecules bound by [[#Ion-dipole forces]] tend to have high melting/boiling points.  

If the intermolecular forces are low, then the boiling and melting point is low. Molecules bound by [[#London Forces]] tend to have low melting/boiling points. 

### Density of Materials
Molecules packed closely together have a higher density. This is for a number of reasons, from small molecule size to strong intermolecular forces. Stronger intermolecular forces will pull molecules closer together, increasing density. 

### Thermal Expansion
Thermal expansion is the change in volume of a substance due to an increase in temperature. As the temperature increases, most substances expand. This expansion is dependent on the strength of the forces between molecules. 

Strong intermolecular forces, such as in [[#Hydrogen bonding forces|Hydrogen Bonds]], will have low thermal expansion. 

Weak intermolecular forces, such as in [[#Ion-induced dipole forces]]. 

### Thermal Conductivity
Molecules that are pulled close together by strong intermolecular forces will be more thermally conductive than elements held together weakly. 

### Viscosity
