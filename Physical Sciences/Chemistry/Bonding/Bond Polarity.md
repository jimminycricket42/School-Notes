# Bond Polarity
[[Polarization]] is the movement of charges within an object to create a more-negatively charged side and a more-positively charged side. This happens when elements [[Bonding|bond]] and form molecules. ^blurb

> A Compound is a number of elements that have bonded together. The total polarity of a molecule is different to the polarity of the elements within the molecule, but they are still closely linked. 

We can show the small changes in electronegativity during bonding by using $\delta^\pm$, which means there is a small positive or negative charge on that element within a bond. 
We can measure this difference using *dipole moment*, denoted with the symbol $\mu$. 

The difference in electronegativity is what causes a bond to be polar or non-polar. 
 
- If there is no difference, meaning $\Delta En = 0$ the bond is non-polar. 
- If the difference is less than 2.1, meaning $\Delta En \leq 2,1$ then the bond is polar.
- If the difference is greater than 2.1, meaning $\Delta En \geq 2,1$ the bond is ionic.
