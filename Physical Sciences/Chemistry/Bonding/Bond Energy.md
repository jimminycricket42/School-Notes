# Bond Energy
The bond energy is the amount of energy released when a [[Bonding|bond]] forms between atoms. It is a measure of the electrostatic forces between two atoms. When the potential electrostatic energy is at it’s lowest, a bond forms.  ^blurb

## Potential Energy during Bonding
Bond energy is the amount of [[potential energy]] of a system with atoms that can bond. The [[Bond Length]], and the [[Charge (Q)]] of each atom affects the potential energy.  

In a system with two atoms, potential energy is *taken to be zero when the atoms are far apart*. As they approach the potential energy is converted to electrostatic force (kinetic energy) as *they begin to attract one-another*. At a certain *distance, they become stable*, and the potential energy is *at it’s minimum*. Here, a chemical bond forms and the attractive and repulsive [[Electrostatics|Electrostatic forces]] are equal.

Bond energy also increases as the amount of bonds between elements increases. This is because the electrostatic force increases, pulling the nuclei of the two atoms closer together and reducing the bond length, therefore increasing the bond energy.
