# Covalent bonding
Covalent bonds are the result of the electrostatic attraction *between the electron bonding pair of an atom and the nucleus of another atom*. Covalent bonding often occurs between two metals. Two [[Atoms|atoms]] “share” [[Atoms|electrons]], forming a weak bond. 

> [!definition]
**Covalent Bonding**: An intermolecular force as a result of the sharing of at least one pair of electrons between two non-metals, resulting in the overlap of the orbitals. 

## Polar and Non-Polar Covalent Bonds
There are two types of covalent bonding, Polar and Non-Polar, characterised by the [[Electronegativity]] of the [[Atoms|atoms]]. 

### Non-Polar Covalent Bonding
Non-Polar covalent bonds (also known as pure covalent bonds) form when there is *even sharing of [[Atoms|electrons]]* caused by *equal [[Electronegativity]]* of the bonding molecules. 

The molecular shapes formed by non-polar covalent bonding can be:
- Linear
- Trigonal Planar’s
- Tetrahedral

### Polar Covalent Bonding
Polar covalent bonds forms when there is an *uneven sharing of [[Atoms|electrons]]* caused by a *difference in the [[Electronegativity]]* of the bonding molecules. This results 

The molecular shapes formed by polar covalent bonds can be:
- Linear
- Angular
- Trigonal Pyramidal

## Properties of Covalent Bonds
- Mostly gases/liquids
- Cannot Conduct Electricity
- Low melting/boiling point

## Structure of Covalent Bonds
### Orbital Overlap
[[Covalent Bonding]] leads to orbital overlaps, where the orbital stretches to overlap both positive nuclei, which share the [[Atoms|electrons]] in the orbital.

### Giant Covalent Structures
There is a special kind of covalent bonding that forms *giant covalent structures*. 

Giant structures are covalent bonds that are far stronger than regular covalent bonds.

#### Diamond
Diamond has four covalent bonds per carbon [[Atoms|atom]]. It is an *[[Allotropes|allotrope]]* of carbon

##### Properties
- **Hardness:** very hard as the covalent bonds are strong. 
- **Melting Point**: very high as a lot of energy is needed o break the bonds
- **Electrical Conductivity**: does not conduct as there are no moving charges.

#### Graphite
Graphite has three bonds per carbon [[Atoms|atom]]. It has layers of hexagonal rings bound by Van de Waals forces, which are far weaker than the bonds. 

##### Properties
- **Hardness**: soft, because layers can slide easily
- **Melting Point**: High as a lot of energy is needed to break the bonds. 
- **Electrical Conductivity**: Conduct electricity, as one electron per carbon [[Atoms|atom]] is delocalised

#### Polymers
Polymers are long chain molecules that are solid at room temperature
