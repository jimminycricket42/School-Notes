# Covalent bonding
**Definition:** Covalent bonds form when the half-filled orbitals of different [[Atomic Structure|atoms]] overlap and an electron pair is shared. 

Covalent bonding often occurs between two metals, as it requires no negative ion. Two [[Atomic Structure|atoms]] “share” [[Atomic Structure|electrons]], forming a weak bond caused by the two [[Atomic Structure|atoms]] temporarily being positive or negative. 

## Polar and Non-Polar Covalent Bonds
There are two types of covalent bonding, Polar and Non-Polar, characterised by the [[Electronegativity]] of the [[Atomic Structure|atoms]]. 

### Non-Polar Covalent Bonding
Non-Polar covalent bonds (also known as pure covalent bonds) form when there is *even sharing of [[Atomic Structure|electrons]]* caused by *equivalent [[Electronegativity]]*. 

### Polar Covalent Bonding
Polar covalent bonds forms when there is an *uneven sharing of [[Atomic Structure|electrons]]* caused by a *difference in the [[Electronegativity]]*

## Properties of Covalent Bonds
- Mostly gases/liquids
- Cannot Conduct Electricity
- Low melting/boiling point

## Giant Covalent Structures
There is a special kind of covalent bonding that forms *giant covalent structures*. 

Giant structures are covalent bonds that are far stronger than regular covalent bonds.

### Diamond
Diamond has four covalent bonds per carbon [[Atomic Structure|atom]]. It is an *[[Allotropes|allotrope]]* of carbon

#### Properties
- **Hardness:** very hard as the covalent bonds are strong. 
- **Melting Point**: very high as a lot of energy is needed o break the bonds
- **Electrical Conductivity**: does not conduct as there are no moving charges.

### Graphite
Graphite has three bonds per carbon [[Atomic Structure|atom]]. It has layers of hexagonal rings bound by Van de Waals forces, which are far weaker than the bonds. 

#### Properties
- **Hardness**: soft, because layers can slide easily
- **Melting Point**: High as a lot of energy is needed to break the bonds. 
- **Electrical Conductivity**: Conduct electricity, as one electron per carbon [[Atomic Structure|atom]] is delocalised

### Polymers
Polymers are long chain molecules that are solid at room temperature
