# Bonding
#GR10/Q2 #chemistry/bonding 

When looking at bonding, we look at three types:
- [[Ionic Bonding]]
- [[Covalent Bonding]]
- [[Metallic Bonding]]

## Intermolecular Forces
These are forces that work between molecules

## Intramolecular Forces
these are forces that bind [[Atomic Structure|atoms]] within a molecule

## Comparison of Different types of bonding
| Property                    | Ionic                               | Covalent        | Metallic                                 |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Melting Point               | Higher                              | Lower           | High                                     |
| Electrical Conductivity     | When in liquid Phase                | None            | Conductive                               |
| Hardness                    | Hard and Brittle                    | Soft            | ductile and malleable                    |
| How atoms are held together | Crystal lattice (electron transfer) | Orbital Overlap | Metallic lattice (delocalised electrons) |

## Structure
### Orbital Overlap
[[Covalent Bonding]] leads to orbital overlaps, where the orbital stretches to overlap both positive nuclei, which share the [[Atomic Structure|electrons]] in the orbital.

### Crystal Lattice
[[Ionic Bonding]] leads to crystal lattices, where tightly-bound [[Atomic Structure|electrons]] are held in place by positive cations that have exchanged [[Atomic Structure|electrons]]

### Metallic Lattice
[[Metallic Bonding]] leads to metallic lattices, where [[Atomic Structure|electrons]] are removed from their cations, forming *kernels* with a ‘sea’ of *delocalised [[Atomic Structure|electrons]]* surrounding them.
