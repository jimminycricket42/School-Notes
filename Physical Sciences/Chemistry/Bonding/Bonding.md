# Bonding
Chemical bonding is the joining of multiple atoms through [[Electrostatics|Electrostatic forces]]. Electrostatic forces work within molecules as [[Intramolecular forces]], and between molecules as [[Intermolecular Forces]]. 

![[Intramolecular forces#^definition]]

## Why do Elements Bond?
Elements bond due to the [[Electrostatics|electrostatic forces]] present between atoms. An [[Atoms|atom]] is made of [[Protons]] and [[Electrons]], which have electrostatic forces acting between them. These forces will *pull the elements together until they are in a stable configuration* with 8 electrons in the outermost shell of the atom. The [[Bond Length]] and [[Bond Energy]] is dependant on how strong the electrostatic forces between the atoms are. 

> [!note] The Octet Rule
> An atom other than hydrogen will bond until it is surrounded by 8 valence electrons. 
> Hydrogen is an exception because it only ever attracts 2 electrons.

We can represent bonding with [[Lewis diagrams]].
