# Ionic Bonding
**Definition:** An Ionic bond is the transfer of electrons and subsequent electrostatic attraction.

Ionic bonding is what occurs between metals and non metals, and it involves electron transfer and the formation of [[Ions]]. 


## Properties of Ionic Bonds
Ionically bound molecules are hard and brittle, they conduct electricity when molten or dissolved, and they have a higher melting point. This is due to them being *Ionic Solids* with a *lattice Structure*


> [!info] Why Ionic bonds conduct in Liquid State
> 
> The reason why electricity can only conduct when in liquid form is due to the crystal lattice. When in solid form, this lattice is too compact to allow *[[Ions]]* to flow. When water or heat is added, it dismantles the lattice and allows the [[Ions]] to flow.

## Properties of Metals and Nonmetals that cause Ionic Bonding
| Metals                             | Non-metals                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Low [[Electronegativity]]          | High [[Electronegativity]]                            |
| Low [[Ionization Energy]]          | High [[electron affinity]]                            |
| Few [[Atomic Structure#Electrons|Valency]] | [[Atomic Structure\|Valence layer]] never more than ½ |

## Representing Ionic Bonding
### Lewis notation

### Formula:
Na → Na<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>-</sup>
Cl + e<sup>-</sup> → Cl<sup>-</sup>
= Na + Cl → Na<sup>+</sup> + Cl <sup>-</sup>
