# Ionic Bonding
An ionic bond is the result of the electrostatic attraction between *two atoms with opposite charges*. Ionic bonding often occurs between metals and non metals. Two atoms transfer [[Electrons]] and form [[Electrons|ions]], forming a strong bond. ^blurb

>[!definition]
**Ionic Bonding**: An Ionic bond is the transfer of electrons and subsequent electrostatic attraction.

## Properties of Ionic Bonds
- Hard and Brittle
- Conduct electricity in liquid phase
- higher Melting/boiling point

> [!extra]+ Why Ionic bonds conduct in Liquid State
> 
> The reason why electricity can only conduct when in liquid form is due to the crystal lattice. When in solid form, this lattice is too compact to allow *[[Electrons]]* to flow. When water or heat is added, it dismantles the lattice and allows the [[Electrons]] to flow.

## Properties of Metals and Nonmetals that cause Ionic Bonding

| Metals                             | Non-metals                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Low [[Electronegativity]]          | High [[Electronegativity]]                            |
| Low [[Ionization Energy]]          | High [[electron affinity]]                            |
| Few Valence electrons | [[Atoms\|Valence layer]] never more than Â½ |

## Structure of Ionic Bonds
### Crystal Lattice
[[Ionic Bonding]] leads to crystal lattices, where tightly-bound [[Atoms|electrons]] are held in place by positive cations that have exchanged [[Atoms|electrons]]
