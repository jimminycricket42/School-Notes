# History of the Atom

## Pre-Electrons
### Hindu Philosophers
**Time**: 500 B.C. 
**Author**: Hindu Philosophers

Hindu philosophers thought that the earth was made of ultimate pieces that were called elements. This consisted of air, water, earth, and fire. They were depicted as balls with different properties, such as colour, flavour, and odour.

### Democritus
**Time**: 400 B.C.
**Author**: Democritus

Democritus believed that [[Atomic Structure|atoms]] were eternally unchanging and were all made of the same substance. He believed they differed in size, shape, and arrangement.

### Lord Kelvin
**Time**: 1867 B.C.
**Author**: Lord Kelvin

Lord Kelvin proposed a “vortex model” of the [[Atomic Structure|atom]], in which [[Atomic Structure|atoms]] ate twisted knots, or vortices, in the ether.

## Post-Electron
### Plum-pudding model
**Time**: 1904
**Author**: JJ Thompson

JJ Thompson proposed the “plum pudding” model of the [[Atomic Structure|atom]], in which negatively-charged [[Atomic Structure|electrons]] rotate in a sphere of positive electricity. He determined this through a *cathode ray tube experiment*

#### Cathode ray tube Experiment
1. Nearly Empty tube (Air has been sucked out) 
2. An electric charge is passed through the tube. Travels from cathode to anode 
3. The charge is invisible, so to see where it travelled a fluorescent screen is placed at back of tube. Where the beam hits, a dot will appear on the screen. You could also use a fluorescent gas and the whole tube will light up. 
4. This beam will always travel straight if not interfered with. 
5. The deflection coils each have a specific charge. One is positive and the other is negative. 
6. Thomson showed (as in the diagram above) that the charge would deflect away from the negative coil. He then stated that this charge was thus a negative charge.

### Nuclear Model
**Time**: Early 1900’s
**Author**: Ernest Rutherford

Ernest Rutherford did a *Gold Foil Scattering Experiment* to prove the [[History of the Atom#Plum-pudding model|plum pudding model]] correct, but instead he proved the existence of the positive nucleus.

### Planetary model
**Time**: 1913
**Author**: Niels Bohr

Bohr proposed that [[Atomic Structure|electrons]] exist in fixed energy levels called orbitals. He said that all [[Atomic Structure|electrons]] have the same energy level, and [[Atomic Structure|electrons]] can move between orbitals by radiating or gaining energy. This is the model we study as the [[Atomic Structure|structure of an atom]].

### Wave-mechanical Model
**Time**: Current
**Author**: Einstein; Others

The wave-mechanical model proposes that electrons can have [[Mechanical Waves|wave-like]] properties, but it can also have a particular position in space. From this came the *uncertainty principle*, which states that you cannot know both the position of an electron as well as the velocity of an electron. 

This further led to the development of the electron orbitals, which state that electrons of differing energy levels are found in certain regions that can be mapped out in space. Within those spaces you are likely to find an electron with. These energy levels correspond with the energy levels within [[#Planetary model|Bohr’s model of the atom]].
