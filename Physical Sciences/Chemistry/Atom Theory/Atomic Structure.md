# Atomic Structure
**Definition**: The smallest particle that retains the chemical properties of an element. ^definition

## Explanation
The structure of an [[atom]] is made up of protons, electrons, and neutrons. The combinations of these is what creates the properties of an atom, such as the elements of [[Periodicity]] and how an atom [[Bonding|bonds]]

## Nucleus of An atom - Protons and Neutrons
At the centre of an atom, we have a *nucleus* made of *protons and neutrons*. Protons are positively charged particles, and neutrons are negatively charged particles. The number of protons is represented by the [[Periodic Table.png|Atomic Number]] of an atom, while the number of protons and neutrons together is the [[Relative Atomic Mass|atomic mass]]. This allows to calculate neutrons through the equation: $\textrm{Atomic Mass} - \textrm{Protons} = \textrm{Neutrons}$. 

The number of protons are constant in each element, and the number of protons is the characteristic trait of each element. The number of electrons will change, as well as the number of neutrons. When the number of neutrons change, an [[isotopes|Isotope]] is formed.

## Electrons
Surrounding the [[#Nucleus of An atom - Protons and Neutrons|Nucleus of an Atom]], there are negatively charged particles called *electrons*. These electrons exist within [[#Electron Shells]]

The amount of electrons found in an atom changes depending on many things, but in a neutral atom the amount of electrons are equal to the amount of protons. When there is an imbalance, then the [[Charge (Q)]] an atom changes. This creates [[Ions]]. 

![[Ions]]

During [[Bonding]], electrons are lost, gained, or shared to create *molecules*.
   
Electrons are negatively charged, so the loss of an electron is an increase in charge, while the gain of an electron is a decrease of charge. This mirrors [[Redox Reactions#Oxidisation Number|oxidisation numbers]] in [[Redox Reactions]]. 

> [!tip] :star_struck:  Extra: Etymology of ‘Electron’
> The word “electron” comes from the Greek word for amber, ‘*electricus*’. The ancient Greeks observed that if you rubbed a piece of amber, you could use it to pick up bits of straw.

### Electron Shells
Electron Shells are the paths that electrons follow when surrounding an atom. Each shell can hold 8 electrons, except the innermost shell which can only hold 2. Each shell is further from the nucleus, and increases the [[Atomic Radius]]. We use [[Representing Atom Structure|Bohr diagrams]] to represent electron shells.

The outermost shell holds *valence electrons*, which are the electrons that transfer during [[Bonding]].

> While it is a valid way of thinking about electron’s positions, the more accurate method is through the [[History of the Atom|electron orbital theory]], which is the basis for [[Electron Configuration]]. 

### Valency of Electrons
The *valency* of an electron is how many electrons must be lost, gained or shared to form a bonding reaction. This is shown in the [[Periodic Table.png]] – Groups 1-3 need to lose electrons, group 4 can gain or lose electrons, and group 5-7 will gain electrons. group 8 will not react because it’s electron shells are all full, making them *inert*. 

| Group | Valency | No. of Valence Electrons |
| ----- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| I     | +1      | 1                        |
| II    | +2      | 2                        |
| III   | +3      | 3                        |
| IV    | ±4      | 4                        |
| V     | -3      | 5                        |
| VI    | -2      | 6                        |
| VII   | -1      | 7                        |
| VIII  | 0       | 8                         |
