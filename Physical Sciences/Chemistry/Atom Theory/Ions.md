# Ions
**Definition**: an [[Atomic Structure|Atom]] or molecule with a net electric charge due to the loss or gain of one or more electrons. ^definition

*Positive ions* are called *cations*

| Protons    | Electrons |
| ---------- | --------- |
| +          | -         |
| +          | -         |
| +          |           |
| [[Charge (Q)]]= | +1        |

> [!example]+ ðŸ’¡ Example: $Na$ Cations
> 
> $Na$ loses an electron to form a positive $Na$ ion, also known as a *cation*
$$Na â†’ Na^+$$ 

*Negative ions* are called *anions*

| Protons     | Electrons |
| ----------- | --------- |
| +           | -         |
| +           | -         |
|            | -         |
| [[Charge (Q)]]= | -1        |


> [!example]+ ðŸ’¡ Example: $P$ Anions
> 
> $P$ gains three electrons to form a negative $P$ ion, also known as an *anion*
$$P â†’ P^{-3}$$

All molecules want a full outer [[Atomic Structure#Electrons|Electron Shell]], and will [[Bonding|bond]] with other electrons to fill their shell.

Electrons can be lost or gained to complete their shell. Losing electrons (e<sup>-</sup>) causes the charge of the ion to increase. Gaining electrons (e<sup>-</sup>) causes the charge of the ion to decrease. We measure this change through [[Redox Reactions#Oxidisation Number|oxidisation numbers]]
