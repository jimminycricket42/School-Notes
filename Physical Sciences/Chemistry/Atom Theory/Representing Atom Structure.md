# Representing Atom Structure
The structure of an atom changes it’s properties, such as its [[Atomic Radius]], [[Electron Affinity]], and [[Electronegativity]]. ^blurb

We have 5 ways to represent atoms:
- Representative diagrams (top)
- Symbolic Notation (bottom)
- Bohr Diagrams

## Representative Diagrams
Representative diagrams are essentially just drawn equivalents of an atom, where [[#Electron Shells]] are shown as circles around a [[#Nucleus of An atom|nucleus]] containing the protons and neutrons. The electron shells are shows as *[[#Bohr Diagrams]]*

## Symbolic Notation
To represent the properties of an atom, symbolic notation was developed, where the amount of protons, the atomic mass, and the symbol of an element could be shown in a shorthand way:

$$\begin{flalign}& ^a_zx 
\\& \textrm{where:} \\& a = \textrm{Atomic Mass} \\& b = \textrm{Atomic Number} \\& z = \textrm{Symbol of element}
\end{flalign}$$

This allows us to quickly show any atom. Let us use Beryllium as an example. It’s symbol is Be, and it has an atomic mass of 9, and a [[Atomic number]] of 4. Below is a diagram showing this physically, but we can also use symbolic notation.

## Bohr Diagrams
Bohr diagrams are a way to combine [[#Representative Diagrams]] and [[#Symbolic Notation]], as well as a great way to visualise [[#Electrons]].
