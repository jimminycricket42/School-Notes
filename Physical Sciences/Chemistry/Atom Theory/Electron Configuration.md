# Electron Configuration
[[Atomic Structure|Electrons]] can be found in various configurations around the [[Atomic Structure|nucleus]] of an atom. This configuration depends of the amount of *electron orbitals*, as well as the overall [[Charge (Q)]] of the electron. ^blurb

Electron orbitals follow the [[History of the Atom#Wave-mechanical Model|wave-mechanical model of atoms]], in that electrons of differing energy levels can be found within orbitals that are found in regions of space. Electron configurations directly relate to these orbitals. 

## The Aufbau Principle
The Aufbau Principle Says that electrons occupy the electron orbitals in order of increasing energy. There are 3 electron orbitals: s-Orbital, p-Orbitals, and d-Orbitals

As we can see above:
- s-orbitals have spherical shapes. They have the least energy. 
- p-orbitals have two lobes. There are 3 p-orbitals in an atom. 
- d-orbitals have 4 lobes. They have the highest energy. 

We only deal with s and p orbitals in gr10. 
- s-orbitals contain 2 electrons
- p-orbitals contain 6 electrons in 3 orbitals, which have 2 electrons each. 

Electrons will always fill the orbital with the least energy before moving onto the next orbital. This principle is known as *Hund’s Principle*. 

## Representing Electron Configuration
### Aufbau Diagrams
Aufbau diagrams show the electron configuration of cells visually, with each electron being represented by an arrow that shows it’s spin, and blocks representing each orbital.

### sp-Notation
We can use sp-notation to represent electron configuration. This shows each orbital as text instead of diagrammatically. 

$$Be: 1s^2 2s^2 2p^4$$

The orbital is shown as $1s$ or $2p$, with the number showing the energy level and the symbol showing the type of orbital. 

The number of electrons within an orbital is shown as an exponent.
