# Neutrons
Neutrons are neutrally-charged subatomic particles found within the [[Atoms|nucleus]] of  the atom. Neutrons make up part of an elementâ€™s [[Relative Atomic Mass]], but they vary in quantity to create [[#Isotopes]].  ^blurb

## Isotopes
Atoms of the same element can have different numbers of neutrons, and each variation is known as an *isotope* of that element.

In nature, most elements exist as isotopes. For instance, in nature we find carbon-12 most commonly, but carbon-13 is also very present. In this case, 12 and 13 represent the [[Relative Atomic Mass|Atomic Mass]] of the element, meaning it is the sum of the [[Protons]] and neutrons. Through this we can calculate that carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, while carbon-13 has 6 protons and 7 neutrons.
