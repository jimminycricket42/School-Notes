# Allotropes
Atoms of the same type can group together in many different ways. Some elements group together with certain structures, and when there are multiple ways an element can group together we call those combinations *allotropes* of one another. ^blurb

> [!definition]
> **Allotropes**: each of two or more different physical forms in which an [[Classification of Matter|element]] can exist.

> [!example] Diamond and Graphite as Allotropes of Carbon
> Diamond and Graphite are allotropes of carbon. They have the same base [[Classification of Matter|element]] â€“ carbon, but their [[Covalent Bonding|Covalent Structures]] are different, giving them different properties.
