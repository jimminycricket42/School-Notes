# Afbau diagrams
Afbau Diagrams apply [[Electrons#Afbau Principle|the Afbau Principle]] to represent the [[Electrons#Electron Configuration|Electron Configuration]] of an atom.  ^blurb

Everything is drawn within blocks that denote the energy levels. 1s is the first energy level, then 2s and 2p before 3s and 3p. This is the same as in [[sp-Notation]]. Higher energy blocks are higher up on the diagram. 

Each electron is written as an arrowhead, with the arrowhead representing the spin of the electron. Two electrons can go in one block, one pointing up and one pointing down.
