# Bohr Diagrams
Bohr diagrams are a way to combine [[#Representative Diagrams]] and [[#Symbolic Notation]], as well as a great way to visualise [[Electrons]]. Electrons are filled into orbitals, with each orbital representing an increasing energy level. The first orbital can only contain two electrons, but every consequent orbital can carry 8 electrons.
