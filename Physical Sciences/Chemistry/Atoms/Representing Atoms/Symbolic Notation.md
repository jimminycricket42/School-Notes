## Symbolic Notation
To represent the properties of an atom, symbolic notation was developed, where the amount of protons, the atomic mass, and the symbol of an element could be shown in a shorthand way:

$$\begin{flalign}
\\& ^a_zx 
\\& \textrm{Where:} 
\\ a &= \textrm{Atomic Mass} 
\\ b &= \textrm{Atomic Number} 
\\ z &= \textrm{Symbol of element}
\end{flalign}$$

> [!example] Beryllium
This allows us to quickly show any atom. Let us use Beryllium as an example. Itâ€™s symbol is Be, and it has an atomic mass of 9, and a [[Atomic Number]] of 4. Below is a diagram showing this physically, but we can also use symbolic notation.
