# Electrons
Electrons are *negatively charged particles* that surround the nucleus of an atom. They exist within orbitals – areas that hold a number of electrons of differing energy levels. Energy, in the form of electrons, is gained and lost during [[Bonding]], creating [[Classification of Matter|compounds]]. ^blurb

> The word electron comes from the Greek word for amber; ‘electricus’. The ancient Greeks observed that if you rubbed a piece of amber, you could use it to pick up pieces of straw. This is a demonstration of [[Electrostatics]]. 

## Valency
Valency measures the change in charge of an atom when [[Bonding]] occurs. This means it is how many electrons must be gained, lost, or shared to form a stable compound. 

*Valence electrons* are electrons that occur in the outermost [[#Electron Orbitals|orbital]] of the atom. They are the electrons that are transferred with other atoms. They are also the [[Redox Reactions|oxidisation number]] of elements in [[Redox Reactions]]. ^valence-electrons

Any element with a full outer orbital is considered stable, as there is no valence electrons. As such, Period 8 of the periodic table is inert and will not interact with other molecules as a result of it’s orbitals being full.

## Electron Orbitals
Electron orbitals are the areas that electrons exist within around an atom. The innermost orbital holds only 2 electrons. Every other orbital can hold up to 8 electrons. 

There are many different ways to represent electrons and their configurations. These representations help us understand the forces acting on the electrons, the positions of the electrons, the amount of energy within a compound, and how they have [[Bonding|bonded]] with other elements. 

We study:
- [[Bohr Diagrams]] – for showing valence electrons
- [[Afbau diagrams]] – for showing electron configuration
- [[sp-Notation]] – for textual representation of electron configuration
- [[Lewis diagrams]] – for showing bonding

> [!note]- The validity of the Electron-orbital theory
> There have been many different theories throughout the [[History of the Atom]] as to how electrons configure themselves, as well as how they fill the space between atoms. Electrons are too small for any microscope to see, and as such, every representation of an electron is just a theory. The current most-accepted theory is the *electron-orbital theory*.

### Electron Configuration
Electrons can be arranged in many ways around the nucleus of an [[Atoms|atom]]. This is dictated by the [[#Afbau Principle]]. It depends on the amount of [[#Electron Orbitals]], as well as the [[Charge (Q)]] of the atom. 

#### Afbau Principle
According to the [[History of the Atom#Wave-mechanical Model|wave-mechanical model of atoms]], Electrons of differing energy levels can be found in different areas around the neutron of the atom. These areas are the orbitals of the atom, and they are where we are most likely to find an electron pair.     

There are three types of orbitals, and each one has different energy levels:

![[Wave-mechanical model.png]]

As we can see:
- S-Orbital have spherical shapes. They contain only 2 electrons, and have the least energy of all the orbitals. 
- P-Orbitals have two lobes. They contain 6 orbitals in 3 sets of lobes, meaning each lobe has only 2 electrons. They have more energy than S-Orbitals. 
- D-Orbitals have four lobes. They have more electrons, and the most energy of all the orbitals. 

Electrons will always fill the orbital with the least energy before moving onto the next orbital. This principle is known as *Hund’s Principle*. 

## Ions
Atoms are called neutral atoms when the amount of protons is equal to the number of electrons. An atom with a non-zero net charge is known as an [[Electrons|ion]].

> [!definition]
> **Ion**: An [[Atoms|atom]] or molecule with a net electrical charge due to the loss or gain of one or more electrons
> > [[Atoms]], [[Charge (Q)]].
^ion-definition

Ions form because electrons will transfer and share between molecules to stabilize atoms. Elements are stable when their outermost orbital is full of electrons. As such, [[Bonding|bonds]] form between atoms. 

Electrons can be lost or gained to complete an atom’s orbital.
- *Losing electrons* causes the charge of the ion to *increase*. 
- *Gaining electrons* causes the charge of the ion to *decrease*. 

We measure this change through [[Redox Reactions#Oxidisation Number|oxidisation numbers]], and we classify ions in two ways:
- Positively charged [[#Cations]]
- Negatively charged [[#Anions]]

### Cations
Positively charged ions are called *cations*. They have more protons in their nucleus than electrons within their outermost orbital. 

| Protons        | Electrons  |
| -------------- | ---------- |
| +              | -          |
| +              | -          |
| +              |            |
| [[Charge (Q)]] | $= +1 e^-$ |

> [!example] $Na$ Cation
> 
> $Na$ loses an electron to form a positive $Na$ ion, also known as a *cation*.
> 
> $$Na - e^- → Na^+$$ 

### Anions
Negatively charged ions are called *anions*. They have more electrons within their outermost orbital than protons within their nucleus. 

| Protons        | Electrons |
| -------------- | --------- |
| +              | -         |
| +              | -         |
|                | -         |
| [[Charge (Q)]] | $=-1e^-$  |
