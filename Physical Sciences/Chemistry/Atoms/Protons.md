# Protons
Protons are positively-charged subatomic particles found within the [[Atoms|nucleus]] of the atom. Their positive charge attracts [[Electrons]], causing [[Bonding]]. They make up a portion of an atoms [[Relative Atomic Mass]]. ^blurb

Protons are *characteristic* of an element, meaning that the distinguisher between elements is the amount of protons that they have.
