# Atoms
Atoms are the smallest particles of matter that retain the properties of an element. Larger substances can be broken down into their atoms. ^blurb

> **Atom**: The smallest particle that retains the chemical properties of an element.

Atoms are made up of certain things, namely [[Protons]], [[Neutrons]], and [[Electrons]]. The combinations create the physical and chemical properties of an element. We study these chemical properties in [[Periodicity]], as well as how atoms bond in [[Bonding]]. 

The atom is made of two parts: [[#The Nucleus]] and [[#The Orbitals]].

## The Nucleus
The nucleus of the atom is where [[Protons]] and [[Neutrons]] are found. The [[Relative Atomic Mass|atomic mass]] is determined by the nucleus, as electrons weigh very little.

## The Orbitals
The orbitals of the atom is where [[Electrons]] are found. Electrons weigh very little, but they are the reason why elements [[Bonding|bond]] in different ways. The orbitals are represented in a couple of ways according to [[History of the Atom|different models of the atom]], but the current standard is [[Representing Atom Structure|Bohr diagrams]].

## Representing Atom Structure
The structure of an atom changes itâ€™s properties, such as its [[Atomic Radius]], [[Electron Affinity]], and [[Electronegativity]]. ^blurb

Above is an example of Representative Notation, which is a combination of the ways we show atoms. The common methods of representing atomic structure are:
- [[Bohr Diagrams]]
- [[Symbolic Notation]]
