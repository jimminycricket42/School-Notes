# Law of Constant Composition
Elements can combine in many ways, however they only combine in certain ratios. These ratio’s are known as the molecule’s molecular formula, and it is dependent on the [[Mole|mole ratio]] of an element. 

> [!definition]
> **Law of Constant Composition**: All samples of a given chemical compound have the same elemental composition.
>
>**Formula**
>$$
\textrm{\% Composition} = \frac{m_{element}}{m_{compound}} \times 100
>$$

> **Question**: Find the Percentage mass of Na in 12g of $Na_2O$
> 
>**Answer**: 
>$$\begin{align} 
&\textrm{Mass Percentage} = \frac{m_{Na}}{m_{Na_2 O}} \times 100
\\& m_{Na} = n(M) = 1(23) = 23g
\\& m_{Na_2O} = n(M) = 2(23) + 16 = 62g
\\& \frac{23}{62} \times 100 = 37,09\% \approx 37\%
\end{align}$$

## Percentage Composition
We can use the law of constant composition to find the empirical formula of a substance if we know the masses of the component elements of the substance. Percentage composition is percentage mass for each element in a compound. 

This can be done by figuring out what percentage mass each element is of the substance, and then converting it into moles and finding the mole’s of each substance. Then we can simplify these numbers of moles into mole ratios, and use that ratio as our [[empirical formula]]. 

> [!example]+ :bulb: Example: Percentage Composition
> Question: A substance with 0,4026g was found containing 0,1610g of carbon, 0,0268g of hydrogen, and 0,2148g of oxygen
> 
> $$\begin{align}
&\textbf{Percentage Composition}
\\& \%C = \frac{m_\textrm{carbon}}{0,4026g} \times 100 = \frac{0,1610g}{0,4026g} \times 100 &&= 40\%
\\& \%H = \frac{m_\textrm{hydrogen}}{0,4026g} \times 100 = \frac{0,0268g}{0,4026g} \times 100 &&= 6.66\%
\\& \%O = \frac{m_\textrm{oxygen}}{0,4026g} \times 100 = \frac{0,2148g}{0,4026g} \times 100 &&= 53,35\%
\end{align}$$
