# Diffusion
Diffusion is the *movement of a liquid or a gas* from an *area of high concentration to an area of low concentration*. It is a *passive* form of transport, as it requires no energy. It also *distributes substances evenly* within the system.  ^blurb

The *diffusion or concentration gradient* is the movement of solutes from *high to low concentration*.  ^87eabc

## Factors affecting the tempo of diffusion
- The *concentration gradient* of the system — the bigger the difference in concentration, the faster diffusion will be.
- The *temperature* in the system — high temperatures promote diffusion, as it creates [[Convection Currents]] that help distribute substances.
- *Pressure* in the system — as the pressure on a system increases, the tempo of diffusion will increase.

When working with diffusion, we will often use [[Standard Temperature and pressure (STP)]] to measure the rate of diffusion. 

## Formula:
To calculate equilibrium, average the [[Water Potential (Ψ)]] of the areas you are dealing with. 

$Ξium = \textrm{average water potential of two areas}$
