# Atomic Radius

**Definition**: Â the total distance from an [[Atoms|atom]]'s nucleus to the outermost orbital of electron. 

**Unit of measure**: angstroms

$$
\textrm{Atomic Radius} = \frac{1}{ \textrm{Electron Affinity}}
$$
[[Electron Affinity]]

## Trend in the Periodic Table
- decreases (becomes further) across a period because the nuclear charge increases, causing the [[Atoms|electrons]] to be drawn closer to the nucleus
- increases (becomes closer) down a group because there is an increase in electron shells that causes the outermost ring to become further from the nucleus
