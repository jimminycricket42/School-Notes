# Periodicity
Periodicity is the study of patterns in the periodic table. ^blurb

We look at:
- [[Density of Atoms]]
- [[Melting Point]]
- [[Atomic Radius]]
- [[Ionization Energy]]
- [[Electron Affinity]]
- [[Electronegativity]]


> [!note] :spiral_notepad: Other forms of periodicity
> Periodicity is also seen in [[Reactivity Series of Halogens]]. The reactivity of halogens increases down a group.
