# Ionisation Energy
**Definition**:then energy required to remove electrons from an element in the gaseous phase

**Unit of Measure**: Kilojoules per Mole (kj.mol<sup>-1</sup>)

## First and second ionisation energy
First ionisation energy is the amount of energy needed to remove the outermost electron from its [[Atomic Structure|atom]]

Second Ionisation Energy is the amount of energy needed to remove an additional electron from a [[Ions|cation]]. This second ionisation energy is higher than the first ionisation energy because more energy is required to remove an electron from a cation than from a neutral [[Electrostatics#Electrical Charge|neutral atom]]. 

## Trend in the Periodic Table
- Ionisation energy increases from left to right across a period due to the decrease in [[Atomic Radius]] causing the attraction between electrons and the nucleus being greater, meaning more energy is required to separate them. 
- Ionisation energy decreases from top to bottom in a group because as you move down a group, the valence electrons move further from the nucleus, weakening the force of attraction and causing the ionisation energy to decrease.
