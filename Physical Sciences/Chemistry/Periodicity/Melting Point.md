# Melting Point

**Definition**: the temperature at which a given solid will melt

**Unit of measure**: Kelvin 

## Trend in the periodic table
- increases in the transition metals due to [[Metallic Bonding]] forming bonds that require large amounts of energy to break 
- non-metals tend to have simple, easy to break atomic structures, as only weak [[Bonding#Intermolecular Forces|intermolecular forces]] are needed to overcome them
