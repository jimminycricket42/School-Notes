# The non-metal Reactions
## Reactions with O<sub>2</sub>
$$
\textrm{non-metal} + \textrm{oxygen} → \textrm{non-metal oxide}_{(g)}
$$
### Properties of non-metal oxides:
- Gases
- Acidic
- Burns special colours
	- Carbon Oxide: Bright orange flame
	- Sulphur Oxide: Violet flame
	- Yellow Phosphorous Oxide: Bright yellow flame
	- White Phosphorous Oxide: Bright white flame

## Non-metal oxides reaction with water
$$
\textrm{non-metal oxide} + \textrm{water} → \textrm{acid}
$$

## Displacement of Halogens
When halogens are added to a solution containing a less reactive halogen, it will react and form a new compound in which the less reactive halogen is displaced.
