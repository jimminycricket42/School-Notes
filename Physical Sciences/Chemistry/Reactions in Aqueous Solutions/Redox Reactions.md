# Redox Reactions
Redox Reactions are *electron-transferring* reactions. Redox is an abbreviation of reduction-oxidisations reactions. There are two types of reactions:
- âž– Reduction reactions, where electrons are gained (and the charge decreases)
- âž• Oxidisation Reactions, where electrons are lost (and the charge increases)

>  **R** â€“ Reduction **I** â€“ is **G** â€“ Gain 


These are categories of reactions that can occur, depending on what happens to the amount of free electrons. We measure this using *Oxidisation Numbers*, which are a measure of the *free electrons* in a reaction

## Oxidisation Number

Oxidisation Number is a measure of free electrons in a reaction. These are electrons that are greater or less than the amount of protons in the nucleus of the atom. 

- When a particle does not have a positive or negative charge, we call it a *Neutral Atom*
- When a particle does have a positive or negative charge, that number is the *Oxidisation Number*.  

We can represent the change of oxidisation number with half-reactions, and we can summarize the full change of electrons in a reaction using a Net-ionic Reactions

### Half-Reactions
Half reactions are another way of showing the steps that redox reactions go through. You show the changes in charges separately, and then summarize it all into a net-ionic reaction
