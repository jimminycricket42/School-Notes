# Mass (m)
Mass is a fundamental property of matter that measures two things: The inertia the matter will experience, as well as the amount of matter in something. It is one of the most important measures in physics and chemistry, and must not be confused with [[Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE)|weight]].

## Inertia
The tendency of an object to keep moving is known as inertia. [[Mass (m)]] is a measure of inertia, which can be seen with heavier objects being harder to move than lighter objects. 

[[Newton's First Law]] and [[Newton's Second Law]] deal with inertia, acceleration and forces acting on an object.
