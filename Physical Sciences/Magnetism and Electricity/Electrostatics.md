# Electrostatics
Electrostatics is the study of static charges. We study the principles of electrostatics, as well as the conservation of [[Charge (Q)]] ^blurb

## Electrical Charge
All objects contain electrical charge to some degree. This charge can either be *positive charge* or *negative charge*. If the amount of positive charge is equal to the amount of negative charge, then there is a *neutral charge*. 

Charges are stored in [[Atomic Structure#Nucleus of An atom|Protons]] or [[Atomic Structure#Electrons|Electrons]], and when the charge is imbalance, [[Ions]] are formed

## Methods of Gaining Charge
### Triboelectric charging through friction
Friction is a transfer of electrons, which is what causes the buildup of heat an energy between two objects that are rubbed together. When rubbed together, one item will gain charge and one item will lose charge. The *triboelectric series* tells us which substance will gain electrons and which substance will lose electrons.

## Conductors and Insulators
We come across two different types of objects when referring to how charge is held and transferred:
- Conductors
- Insulators

### Conductors
Conductors are materials where charges *are free to move*. These charges will *spread evenly over the whole object*, and they will attempt to transfer into anything that they come in contact with so long as they are not repulsed. Conductors will lose their charge if *grounded*, meaning they must be charged while not in contact with another conductor. 

### Insulators
Insulators are materials where charges are *not free to move*. Some Insulators can be charged by *rubbing* them repeatedly. This will either *add* or *remove* charges, and is called *triboelectric charging*


## Polarisation
Polarisation is the shift of charges within an object due to the [[#Repulsion and Attraction of Charges]]. In [[#Insulators]], this can cause *one side to be more positive* and the other *side to be more negative*. These charged sides are called *poles*, and that is what gives polarisation itâ€™s name.

## Forces of Charges exerted on charged objects
Charged objects exert force on each other through [[Electrical Fields]].

![[Electrical Fields]]

The Repulsion and Attraction of Charges causes charged objects to exert forces on one another. This force is *stronger when the objects are closer* to one another, and *weaker when the objects are further apart*. 

### Repulsion and Attraction of Charges
We know that charges can be positive or negative. These charges will repel or attract one-another, as with [[magnetism|magnets]]:
- Like charges repel
- Different charges attract
- Neutral charges are neutral â€“ they do not repel or attract other charges
