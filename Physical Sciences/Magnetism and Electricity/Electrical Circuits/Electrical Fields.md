# Electrical Fields
Electrical fields occur around [[Electrostatics#Electrical Charge|Charged object]]. This will influence anything within the electrical field, often in the form of *movement*. When a charged object is present in an electrical field, it will have *electrical potential energy*, which acts like [[Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE)]] in the sense that it will move any object within the field unless there is something to stop it. The work done per unit of positive charge is known as the [[Potential Difference (V)]] or voltage of an object within an electrical field.  ^blurb
