# Electrical Circuits
Electrical circuits consist of travelling [[Atoms|Electrons]] that allow for [[Work done|work to be done]]. These electrons need a force to push them, which we call [[Potential Difference (V)]]. Potential Difference causes [[Charge (Q)]] to move, and the measure of how much charge moves is [[Electrical Current (I)]]. [[Resistance (R)]] prevents charge from moving unless the [[Potential Difference (V)]] is overcome. ^blurb

## Closed Circuits
[[Charge (Q)]] runs from a *positive terminal* to a *negative terminal*, and in order to travel that distance is needs a [[Conductors and Insulators|conductive]] material that connects the two terminals.

*Switches* can be used to easily open and close circuits. 

## Types of Circuits: Series and Parallel
There are two types of circuits: *series and parallel* circuits. They can be combined to form hybrids, but overall they are unique types of circuits classified by how their components are connected. 

### Series Circuits
In a series circuit all the components are connected across a single path. This causes [[Potential Difference (V)]] and [[Resistance (R)]] to increase with each component.

- Resistance will be a Voltage Divider $V_T = V_1 + V_2 + V_3$
- Total Resistance will be a sum of all resistances within a series circuit $R_T= R_1 + R_2 + R_3$
- Charge is Constant $Q_1 = Q_2 = Q_3$

### Parallel Circuits
Parallel circuits have their components connected across multiple paths. This divides the [[Electrical Current (I)|current]] and causes [[Resistance (R)]] to decrease with each resistor.

- Voltage is constant $V_1 = V_2 = V_3$
- Resistance decreases a there are more paths for current to travel through $\frac{1}{R_T}=\frac{1}{R_1} +\frac{1}{R_2} +\frac{1}{R_3}$
- - Charge Divider as the charge must move through each path in the circuit $Q_T = Q_1 + Q_2 + Q_3$

## Drawing Electrical Circuits
There is a key that is used when drawing electrical circuits:

Components are connected by lines that represent wires. 

## Values within a Circuit
When values change within a circuit, there are other values that will also change, such as:
- [[Electrical Current (I)|current]]
- [[Resistance (R)]]
- [[Potential Difference (V)]]
