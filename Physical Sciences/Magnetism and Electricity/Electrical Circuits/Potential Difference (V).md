# Potential Difference (V)
**Definition**: [[Work done]] to move one coulomb of charge through the circuit. 

**Unit of Measure**: Volts (V)

**Formula**: 
$$\begin{flalign}
\\& V=\frac{W}{Q}
\\&
\\& \textrm{Where V is Potential difference in volts(V)}
\\& \textrm{Where W is Energy in Joules (J)}
\\& \textrm{Where Q is Charge in Coloumbs (C)}
\end{flalign}$$

$$\begin{align}
\\ && V = \frac{W}{Q}
\\ & \textrm{Where: }
\\ & V = && \textrm{Potential Difference } (V)
\\ & W = && \textrm{Energy } (J)
\\ & Q = && \textrm{Charge } (C)
\end{align}$$
> [[Energy]]; [[Charge (Q)]]

## Explanation
You can see potential difference like a pushing force that is trying to move [[Charge (Q)|charges]] throughout a [[Electrical Circuits]]. 

We use this equation to calculate the amount of energy needed to move one unit of [[Charge (Q)]] through a circuit. 

### EMF vs Potential Difference
EMF is only measured *across a cell or a battery*. EMF is the *maximum energy* a battery can provide. 
Potential difference can be measured *anywhere within a closed circuit*, and can be used to see *how much energy a component drains* by measuring *how much energy returns to the cell or battery*. 

> [!tip] :star_struck: Extra: The Chemistry of Batteries, EMF, and Potential Difference
> Inside of batteries there are two sides, called terminals. Chemical reactions occur inside of the battery that forces positive charges to move to one terminal, and negative charges to the other. This separation is what causes there to be an electric field that forces electrons to move in one direction. 
> 
> This separation relies on stored chemical potential energy, and when that energy is used, the battery is depleted because the reaction that causes a push of electrons can no longer occur.

### Measuring Potential Difference
A *Voltmeter* is used to measure the potential difference. It must be connected in series across a cell/lightbulb/resistor. 

The symbol for a voltmeter is:

## Total Potential Difference
Total Potential Difference changes depending on whether a [[Electrical Circuits#Types of Circuits: Series and Parallel|circuit is series or parallel]]. 


### Total Potential Difference in Series Circuits
When in series, the current must go through each resistor in a circuit, meaning that work must be done at each point of resistance. Therefore the Total Potential Difference will be the sum of all the potential differences of the circuits components

$$
V = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 â€¦ Vn
$$

This mirrors [[Resistance (R)#Total Resistance in Series]]

### Total Potential Difference in Parallel Circuits
When in parallel, the potential difference across each resistor remains the same. 

$$V_1 = V_2 = V_3 = â€¦ $$
