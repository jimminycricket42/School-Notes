# Electromotive force (EMF)
**Definition**: The maximum energy supplied by a cell per one coloumb of charge

**Unit of Measure**: Volts (V)

## Where EMF is Measured
EMF is measured across the battery of a circuit when there is no [[Electrical Current (I)|current]] flowing through the circuit. It is the maximum charge a battery provides. EMF is a measurement of the *chemical potential energy* available within a cell, and when they energy is depleted, then the battery is ‘dead’.
