# Resistance (R)
**Definition**:  the degree to which a substance or device opposes the passage of an electric current, causing energy dissipation. 

**Unit of Measure**: OHM (Ω)

## Formula
The formula for Resistance follows [[Ohm's Law]]

\\ 2 : 4 = V_1 : V_2

\\ V_1 = 4; V_2 = 8
\end{gather}$$
> $$\begin{gather}
\textrm{Total Electrical Current}
\\ R = \frac{V}{I}
\therefore I = \frac{V}{R}
\\ R_T = R_1 + R_2 = 2\ohm + 4\ohm = 6\ohm
\\ V_T = 12V
\\ I = \frac{12}{6} = 2 A →

## Explanation
Resistors are bad [[Conductors and Insulators|conductors]] – they allow energy to flow through them, but some energy is lost and they resist the flow of the charge. 

### Ohm’s Law
Resistors follow Ohm’s Law, which states:

![[Ohm's Law#^definition]]

## Calculating Total Resistance
Total resistance changes depending on whether a [[Electrical Circuits#Types of Circuits: Series and Parallel|circuit is series or parallel]]. 

### Total Resistance in Series
When in series, the current must go through each resistor in a circuit, meaning that the total resistance will increase with each added resistor. 

$$
R_s = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 … R_n
$$

This mirrors [[Potential Difference (V)#Total Potential Difference in Series Circuits]], which means that resistors in series are *potential difference dividers*

### Total Resistance in Parallel
When in parallel, the total resistance decreases because the electricity has more paths that it can move across. 

$$
\frac{1}{R_p} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_3} + … +\frac{1}{R_n}
$$

## Properties of Materials that affect Resistance
There are 4 properties of a material that will affect its conductivity:
- Length
- Width of Cross-section
- Material 
- Temperature

### Length
The longer the object, the further the [[Charge (Q)]] has to travel, increasing the resistance.

### Width of Cross-section
The wider the cross section, the more [[Charge (Q)]] can pass through the object at once, decreasing the resistance.

### Material
Different materials are more or less resistive than others, which will affect the rate of flow of electrons. 

### Temperature
The temperature can increase the speed at which electrons move, as well as create larger gaps between nuclei that electrons can travel through. As temperature increases the resistance will decrease.
