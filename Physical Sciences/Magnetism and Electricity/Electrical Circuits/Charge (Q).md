# Charge (Q)
**Definition**: a fundamental property of objects that experience and exert electrical forces ^definition

**Unit of Measure**: Coulomb (C)

## Formulae
### Quantisation of Charge 
$$\begin{flalign}
\\& Qe^-; Qp^+ = \pm 1,6 \times 10^{-19} C

\\& \textrm{Where:}
\\& \therefore Qe^-; Qp^+ \in \mathbb{W}
\\& C = \textrm{charge in Coulomb}
\\& Qp^+ = \textrm{charge of protons}
\\& Qe^- = \textrm{charge of electrons}
\end{flalign}$$

> [!NOTE] Multiples of $e^-$
>
> All charges will only ever be in multiples of $\pm 1,6 \times 10^{-19}$ because you can only have whole [[Atomic Structure|electrons]], you cannot have $\frac{1}{2}E^-$, it simply does not exist. 

### Net charge while in contact 
$$
Q1 + Q2
$$

### Resultant of [[Electrostatics#Methods of Gaining Charge|Transfer of charges]] 
$$
\frac{Q_1 + Q_2}{2}
$$


## Law of Conservation of Charge
**Law:** The net charge of an isolated system remains constant during any physical process.
