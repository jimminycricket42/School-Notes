# Electrostatic interactions
Charged objects exert force on each other through [[Electrical Fields]]. This [[Forces#Non-contact Forces|non-contact force]] is directly proportional to the strength of each charge, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. ^blurb

^Coulombs-law

Coulombs Law tells us that charged objects will exert force on one another when within each-other's [[electrical fields]]. Is known as an electrostatic interaction. 

Electrostatic interactions follow [[Newtons Third Law]], where two charges will exert the same magnitude of force in the opposite direction to one another. The *net electrostatic force* can be determined by doing [[Vector Operations|vector sums]] of all forces acting on a point. 

### Repulsion and Attraction of Charges
We know that charges can be positive or negative. These charges will repel or attract one-another, as with [[magnetism|magnets]]:
- Like charges repel
- Different charges attract
- Neutral charges are neutral â€“ they do not repel or attract other charges
