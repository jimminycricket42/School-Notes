# Charge (Q)

Electrical charge is the property of an object that causes it to experience a force when near other electrically charged objects. All objects contain electrical charge to some degree. This charge can either be *positive charge* or *negative charge*. If the amount of positive charge is equal to the amount of negative charge, then there is a *neutral charge*. ^blurb

Charges are stored in [[Atoms#Nucleus of An atom|Protons]] or [[Atoms#Electrons|Electrons]]. An [[Electrons|ion]] is the result of there being an unequal amount of protons and electrons, which results in a positive or negative charge. Only *electrons can transfer* between atoms, which is the basis of [[Bonding]], and results in the quantisation of charge where all charges will exist as a multiple of the charge of an electron. 

- An object with an equal amount of protons and electrons is *neutrally charged*. 
- An object that has *lost* electrons has a *positive charge*, as there are now more protons than electrons.
- An object that has *gained electrons* has a *negative charge*, as there are now more electrons than protons.

## Law of Conservation of Charge

> [!law]
**Law of Conservation of Charge:** The net charge of an isolated system remains constant during any physical process. 

When two objects touch, they share charges. If they are then removed, then the net charge must remain the same, but it will divide across both objects. This gives us the formula:
$$
\frac{Q_1 + Q_2}{2}
$$

To calculate how many electrons are in an object, we can *divide the charge of the object by the charge of one electron*, giving us the formula:

$$
e^- \textrm{ in object}= \frac{Q_\textrm{object}}{Q_\textrm{electron}} = \frac{Q}{1,602 \times 10^{-19}}
$$
