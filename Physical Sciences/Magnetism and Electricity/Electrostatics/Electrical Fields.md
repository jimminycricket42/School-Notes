# Electrical Fields
Electrical fields occur around [[Electrostatics#Electrical Charge|Charged objects]]. Two charged objects within each-other's fields will [[Electrostatic interactions|interact according to Coulombs’ Law]]. A charged object within an electrical field has [[Forces#Electrostatic Force|electric ]] [[Potential energy]]. ^blurb

> **Electrical Fields**: The space around an electrically charged object where another electrically charged object will experience an electrostatic force. 
^electrical-field-definition

The direction of the electrical field is the same as the direction of the [[Electrostatic interactions|Electrostatic force]] that it would apply on a positive charge. 

A charge within an electrical field will move according to the direction of the electrical field. A *positive charge will move towards negative*, while a *negative charge will move towards positive*. 

## The movement of Electrons due to Electrical Fields
The work done per unit of positive [[Charge (Q)]] is known as the [[Potential Difference (V)]] or voltage of an object within an electrical field. This is what causes electrons to flow through [[Electrical Circuits]]. The positive and negative poles of a battery or energy source ‘pushes’ electrons through a [[Conductors and Insulators|conductor]], causing a flow of energy.

## Representing Electrical Fields
Electrical fields can be shown using electrical field lines.  

Electrical field lines diagrams follow some conventions:
- Arrows on the lines indicate the direction of the field
- Electrical field lines point away from positive charges and towards negative charges
- Field lines are drawn closer together where the field is stronger
- Field lines do not touch or cross each other
- Field lines are drawn perpendicularly to a charge or charged surface
- The stronger the charge, the stronger the field. This is shown by drawing more field lines around the charge.

## Electrical Field Strength
Electrical field strength is measured in Newtons per coulomb ($N.C^{-1}$).

>> $$\begin{align}
>> \\ & \vec{E} = \frac{k\vec{Q}}{r^2}
>> \\ & Where:
>> \\ \vec{E} & = \textrm{Electric Field Strength} & (N.C^{-1})
