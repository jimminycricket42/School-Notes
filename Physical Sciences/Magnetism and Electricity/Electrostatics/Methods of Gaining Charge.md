# Methods of Gaining Charge
[[Charge (Q)]] can increase or decrease through an exchange of [[Atoms|Electrons]], as outlined by [[Charge (Q)#Law of Conservation of Charge|The law of conservation of charge]]. ^blurb

## Triboelectric charging through friction
[[Friction]] is a transfer of electrons, which is what causes the buildup of heat an energy between two objects that are rubbed together. When rubbed together, one item will gain charge and one item will lose charge. The *triboelectric series* tells us which substance will gain electrons and which substance will lose electrons.
