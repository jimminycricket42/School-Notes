# Conductors and Insulators
We come across two different types of objects when referring to how charge is held and transferred: ^blurb
- [[#Conductors]]
- [[#Insulators]]

### Conductors
Conductors are materials where charges *are free to move*. These charges will *spread evenly over the whole object*, and they will attempt to transfer into anything that they come in contact with so long as they are not [[Electrostatic interactions|repulsed]]. 

Conductors will lose their charge if *grounded*, meaning they must be charged while not in contact with another conductor. 

### Insulators
Insulators are materials where charges are *not free to move*. Some Insulators can be charged by *rubbing* them repeatedly. This will either *add* or *remove* charges, and is called [[Methods of Gaining Charge|triboelectric charging]]. 

Insulators within [[Electrical Fields]] can undergo [[Polarization]].
