# Transverse Waves
Transverse waves are repeated disturbances within a medium. Transverse waves occur when the displacement of the wave is perpendicular to the direction of *propagation* (the direction in which the wave travels).  ^blurb

> Sin, Cos, and Tan can be used to graph wavelengths. This is because triangles, circles, and waves are all linked – waves are essentially cut and deformed circles, while any right-angled triangle can be found within a sphere. 

## Properties of Transverse Waves
We can get a number of datapoints about a wave, including:
- [[Wavelength (λ)]]
- [[Amplitude (r)]]
- [[Period (T)]] and [[Frequency (f)]]
- [[Wave Speed (v)]]

### Wavelength
![[Wavelength (λ)#^definition]]
![[Wavelength (λ)#^transverse]]

In electromagnetic waves, the wavelength is linked to the energy of the wave, and waves with more energy appear higher on the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].  

### Amplitude
![[Amplitude (r)#^definition]]
![[Amplitude (r)#^transverse]]

Amplitudes of waves can change through [[Superposition of Waves]]

### Period (T) and Frequency (f)

## Transverse waves and Pendulums
The motion of pendulums can be shown as transverse waves – they *oscillate* between two points much like transverse waves do.

$A → B \textrm{ or } B → C = r$

$A → B → C → B → A = \textrm{one vibration length (wavelength)}$

**Period**: Time it takes for one vibration length to occur

**Frequency**: Amount of vibration lengths that occur in a second
