# Sound
Sound is a form of [[Longitudinal Waves]]. Sound originates from vibrating objects that cause changes of pressure in the air that creates what we know as sound. ^blurb

## Sound in different mediums
Sound travels differently depending on the medium it travels through:
- Sound travels best in solids
- Sound travels well  in liquids
- Sound travels poorly in gasses

This is because the density of an object affects how well the wave can travel through it. As particles bump together due to a sound wave, they transfer the energy and the oscillation to the next set of particles. This means that substances with particles which are closer together will transfer soundwaves better than substances with particles that are far apart. 

This change in the travel is also apparent with the temperature. When the temperature is higher, it means that the particles will collide and interact more, causing the rate of propagation to increase. So when the temperature of air is 0°c, the speed of sound will be slower than when the temperature of air is 20°c. This is further explored in [[#The Speed of Sound]]

## The Speed of Sound
The speed of sound at an air temperature of 0°c is $331m.s^{-1}$ . This changes with the temperature of the air, because of how [[#Sound in different mediums|sound in different mediums act]]. 

The speed of sound can be calculated the same way that [[Wave Speed (v)]] can be calculated. 

## Properties of Sound
Our ears can perceive many properties of sound, which we call *pitch, loudness, and sound quality*. 

visually we can represent this using a tool called an *oscilloscope*.

### Pitch of Sound
The pitch of sound is determined by the [[Frequency (f)]] of the note. Higher frequencies resonate with a higher pitch.

### Loudness of sound
Loudness is determined by
