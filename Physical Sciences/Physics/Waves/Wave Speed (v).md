# Wave Speed (v)
**Definition**: The distance travelled by a wave in a certain time.  ^definition

**Unit of Measure**: metres per second (m.s<sup>-1</sup>)

**Formula**:
Given distance or time
$$
\begin{flalign}
\\& v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}

\\& Where:
\\& v = \textrm{Wave Speed } (m.s^{-1})
\\& \Delta x = \textrm{Distance } (m)
\\& \Delta t =  \textrm{Time } (s)
\end{flalign}
$$
Given [[Frequency (f)]]
$$
\begin{flalign}
\\& v = f\times\lambda
\\& Where:
\\& f = \textrm{Freqency } (Hz)
\\& v = \textrm{Wave Speed } (m.s^{-1})
\\& \lambda = \textrm{Wavelength } (m)
\end{flalign}
$$
Given [[Period (T)]]
$$
\begin{flalign}
\\& v = \frac{\lambda}{T}
\\& Where:
\\& T = \textrm{Period } (s)
\\& \lambda = \textrm{Wavelength } (m)
\\& v = \textrm{Wave Speed } (m.s^{-1})
\end{flalign}
$$

## Factors affecting wave speed
The wave speed has to do with the *type of material* the wave is travelling through, as well as the *density* and *temperature* of the material.
