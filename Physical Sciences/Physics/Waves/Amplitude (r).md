# Amplitude (r)
**Definition**: Amplitude is the maximum displacement a wave has from itâ€™s equilibrium position. ^definition

**Unit of Measure**: metres (m)

## Transverse vs Longitudinal waves
In [[transverse waves]] the amplitude can be measured from the equilibrium to a peak or trough. ^transverse

In [[Longitudinal Waves]] the amplitude is the maximum distance that particles move from their rest position, it can be measured from wherever the neutral position on a longitudinal wave is to the point of furthest movement. ^longitudinal
