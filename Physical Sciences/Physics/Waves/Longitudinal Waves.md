# Longitudinal Waves
Longitudinal waves are *repeated disturbances* within a medium where the displacement of particles is *parallel to the direction of displacement*. ^blurb

## Compression and Rarefaction of Longitudinal Waves
*Compressions* are areas within a longitudinal wave where the particles are closest together. 

*Rarefactions* are areas within a longitudinal wave where the particles are furthest apart.

## Properties of Longitudinal Waves
We look at:
- [[Wavelength (位)]]
- [[Amplitude (r)]]
- [[Period (T)]] and [[Frequency (f)]]
- [[Wave Speed (v)]]

## Representing Longitudinal Waves
You can represent the change in pressure of particles affected by a longitudinal wave as a sine curve, where the [[Wavelength (位)]] is the difference between crests or troughs

**Variation in pressure over time graph**: 
```desmos-graph
y=2\sin(1/2x\ + 1.5\pi)
x = 2 * \pi 
x = - 2 * \pi 
(2\pi, 2) | label: B
(-2\pi, 2) | label: A
```
> Point A would be the centre of one compression, while point B would be the centre of another.
