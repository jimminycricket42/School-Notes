# Superposition of Waves
Superposition causes interference, which is a phenomena that occur when two [[Transverse Pulses]] or two [[Transverse Waves]] occupy the same space. This causes the waves to *interfere with each other*,  and the displacement of the waves from equilibrium position will change. This change will be the sum of the displacement of the two initial waves/[[Transverse Pulses|pulses]]. ^blurb


## Constructive Interference
Interference is constructive when the two [[Transverse Pulses|pulses]] are both displaced in the same direction from the equilibrium position. This causes the displacement to increase when they meet, as the resultant displacement is the sum of the the displacement of the waves.

## Destructive Interference
Interference is constructive when the two [[Transverse Pulses|pulses]] are  displaced in different directions from the equilibrium position. This causes the displacement to decrease when they meet, as the resultant displacement is the sum of the the displacement of the waves.
