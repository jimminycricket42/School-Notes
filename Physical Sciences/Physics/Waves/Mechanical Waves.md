# Mechanical Waves
Waves are disturbances within a medium. Light, sound, and radiation are all examples of things that work as waves. Waves have enabled the modern digital age through [[Computer Networks#Unbounded Transmission Media|satelite networks]]. The entire [[electromagnetic spectrum]] consists of [[Transverse Waves]]. 

**Waves Definition**: Waves are a disturbance within a medium. ^definition

## Types of Waves
In physics we get two kinds of waves – [[Longitudinal Waves]] and [[transverse waves]]. These two waves have some similar concepts, but handle them quite differently.
%%TODO: find the differences for the other concepts and tabulate them%%

### Waves vs Pulses
1 wave is made of 2 [[Transverse Pulses|pulses]]
```desmos-graph
left=-2; right=2;
top=2; bottom=-2;
---
y=\sin(2x)
(\pi/2,0)|label:C
(0,0)|label:B
(\pi/-2,0)|label:A
```
> A → B is one pulse, but A → C is a wave

## Properties of Waves
Waves have a number of properties, including:
- [[Amplitude (r)]]
- [[Frequency (f)]] and [[Period (T)]]
- [[Wave Speed (v)]]
- [[Wavelength (λ)]]
