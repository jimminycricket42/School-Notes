# Electromagnetic Spectrum
The electromagnetic spectrum is the rage of frequencies that encompass all *electromagnetic radiation*. The whole of electromagnetic radiation is a massive spectrum that encompasses everything from radio waves to visible light to gamma radiation. ^blurb

## Nature of Electromagnetic Waves
Electromagnetic waves are produced when charged particles accelerate, resulting in [[Electrical Fields]] and [[magnetic fields]] that Oscillate at right angles to the direction of propagation of a wave (making them [[Transverse Waves]]).

EM waves carry [[Energy]], which we can [[#Measuring EM radiation: Photons|measure using photons]]. This energy can also pass to objects. 

EM waves act as both a particle and a wave, which we know as [[#Wave-Particle duality]]. 

EM waves travel at the [[#Speed of light]], and they do not need a medium to travel through, unlike [[Mechanical Waves]]. 

## Types of Electromagnetic Radiation
We group the electromagnetic spectrum into 7 distinct categories:
![[Electromagnetic Spectrum Diagram.jpg]]

We pay special attention to:
- Radio Waves
- Infra-red Radiation
- Visible Light
- Ultra-violet radiation
- X-rays
- Gamma rays

### Radio Waves
Radio waves are the longest form of EM radiation with the lowest [[Energy]]. They can be up to several hundred kilometres long, or as short as 10mm. 

**Radio Broadcasts** use Very High Frequency (VHF), and they have a wavelength of about 3m.

**Televisions** use Ultra High Frequency (UVF) waves to transfer sound and images, and they have a wavelength of between 0,1m to 1m. 

**Satellites and and telephones** use Microwaves, the most energetic form of radio waves, and they have wavelengths of around 120mm.

### Infra-red Radiation
Infra-red Radiation is emitted by all hot objects. We cannot see them, but we can feel them as heat. They are also known as heat rays. 

### Visible Light
Visible light is actually a very small part of the EM spectrum. It ranges from a frequency of $8 \times 10^{-7}m$ (showing red light) until $4 \times 10^{-7}m$ (showing violet right). 

### Ultra-violet radiation
Ultra violet radiation is what causes sunburn. It is invisible and full of [[Energy]]. It can Ionise some particles due to the amount of [[Energy]] it has. 

### X-rays
X-rays are released when particles are hit by high-speed [[Atomic Structure|electrons]]. They can penetrate the soft tissues of the human body, and even be used to kill some forms of cancer. 

### Gamma Rays
Gamma rays are more penetrating than x-rays, and they come from the transformations that occur within the nuclei of radioactive materials. 

## Measuring EM radiation: Photons
We use *photons* to measure light. Photons are essentially ‘packages’ of light that are emitted and absorbed. 

**Photon Definition:** A quanta of light

### Planck’s Constant
Light has [[Energy]], and the amount of [[Energy]] is dictated by the frequency of the light as well as *Planck’s constant*. 

Planck’s constant is $6,63 \times 10^{-34} J.s^{-1}$ and the symbol for it is $h$. 

### Energy of Photon
$$
\begin{gather}
\\& E = hf
\\
\\& Where:
\\& E = \textrm{Energy } (Joules)
\\& h = \textrm{Planck's constant } (J.s) = 6,63 \times 10^{-34} J.s^{-1}
\\& f = \textrm{frequency } (Hz)
\end{gather}
$$
[[Energy]]; [[Frequency (f)]]

### Energy of EM Radiation
We can use Planck’s constant in conjunction with the [[#Speed of light]] to find out the [[Energy]] of any wave using the formula below. 

$$\begin{gather}
\\& E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\\
\\& Where:
\\& E = \textrm{Energy } (unitOfMeasure)
\\& h = \textrm{Planck's Constant } (J.s^{-1}) = 6,63 \times 10^{-34} J.s^{-1}
\\& c = \textrm{Speed of light } (m.s^-1) = 3 \times 10^{8} m.s^{-1}
\\& \lambda = \textrm{Wavelength } (m)
\end{gather}$$
[[Energy]]; [[#Speed of light]]; [[#Planck’s Constant]]; [[Wavelength (λ)]]

## Speed of light
All electromagnetic radiation travels at the speed of light, which is:

$$\begin{gather}
\\& C = 3 \times 10^{8} m.s^{-1}
\\
\\& Where:
\\& C = \textrm{Speed of light } (m.s^{-1})
\end{gather}$$

C is a measure of [[Wave Speed (v)]], which means we can also use the equation:
$$\begin{gather}
\\& C = f\lambda 
\\
\\& Where:
\\& C = \textrm{Speed of light } (m.s^{-1})
\\& f = \textrm{Frequency } (Hz)
\\& \lambda = \textrm{Wavelength } (m)
\end{gather}$$

## Wave-Particle duality
EM radiation has two weird properties: It can *behave as either a wave or a particle*. It exhibits both *wave-like* behaviour, and *particle-like* behaviour. This distinguishes it from [[Mechanical Waves]], as it *does not need a medium to propagate* through. This joint property is known as *wave-particle duality*.
