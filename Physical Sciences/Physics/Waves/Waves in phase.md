# Waves in Phase
Points along a wave are in phase when the points at the same displacement from the equilibrium, and when the points are moving in the same direction. ^blurb

```desmos-graph
y=\sin(x)+2
y=\sin(x)-2
(0,-2)|label:B
(0,2)|label:A
```
> Graphs A and B are in phase

```desmos-graph
y=\sin(x)+2
y=\sin(-x)-2
(0,-2)|label:B
(0,2)|label:A
```
> Graphs A and B are out of phase
