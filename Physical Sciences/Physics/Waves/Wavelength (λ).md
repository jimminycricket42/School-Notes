# Wavelength (λ)
**In Transverse Waves**: The wavelength is the distance between two consecutive points that are in [[Waves in phase|phase]]. ^definition

**Unit of Measure**: metres (m)

Given [[Frequency (f)]]
$$
\begin{flalign}
\\& v = f\times\lambda
\\& \therefore \lambda = \frac{v}{f}
\\& Where:
\\& f = \textrm{Freqency } (Hz)
\\& v = \textrm{Wave Speed } (m.s^{-1})
\\& \lambda = \textrm{Wavelength } (m)
\end{flalign}
$$
> [[Wavelength (λ)]]; [[Wave Speed (v)]]; [[Frequency (f)]]

## Transverse vs Longitudinal waves
In transverse waves the wavelength is often measured between crests or troughs. ^transverse

In longitudinal waves the wavelength is measured between the centres of two compressions or two rarefactions. ^longitudinal
