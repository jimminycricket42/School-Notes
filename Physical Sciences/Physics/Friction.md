# Friction
Friction is a force that opposes motion. It is caused by very minor imperfections in the surface of an object. An object can experience *static friction when not moving* or *kinetic friction when moving*.   ^blurb
> [!definition]
> **Friction**: A contact force exerted by a surface onto an object parallel to a surface and opposite to the direction of motion or attempted motion. 
> 
> Friction is determined by the *coefficient of friction*, represented by $\mu$. The coefficient of friction changes depending on the materials two objects are made of. In general, rougher materials have a higher coefficient of friction.

>**Formula**: 
>$$\begin{align}
& f = \mu \times F_N \\
& \textrm{Where: } \\
f & =  \textrm{Friction } (N, \degree) \\
\mu & =  \textrm{Coefficient of Friction } \\  
F_N & =  \textrm{Normal Force } (N \perp \textrm{ to the surface}) 
\end{align}$$

## Static and Kinetic Friction
**Static Friction** is represented by $f_s$ and is present when velocity is zero. It is equal to the applied force, but opposite in direction. There is a maximum amount of opposing force static friction can apply before motion occurs. This maximum depends on the coefficient of static friction. 

**Kinetic Friction** is represented as $f_k$, and is present when velocity is not zero. Kinetic friction is less than the maximum static friction $f_k < f_{s\textrm{ max}}$. Kinetic friction occurs when the force applied overcomes the $f_{s\textrm{ max}}$.
