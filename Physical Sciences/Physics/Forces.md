# Forces (N)
Forces can be defined as a push or a pull. A force being applied to an object is a [[Vectors and Scalar|vector]], meaning it has magnitude and direction. ^blurb

**Unit Of measure:** Newtons (N

## Types of Forces
There are two overarching groups of forces:
- [[#Non-contact Forces]]
- [[#Contact Forces]]

### Non-contact Forces
There are 3 non-contact forces we look at:
- Gravitational Force
- [[Electrostatics|Electrostatic Force]]
- [[magnetism|Magnetic force]]

#### Gravitational Force
This is the force with which the earth, moon, or other massively large object attracts another object towards itself. The force is exerted indirectly 
through a field.

Gravitational Force is what creates [[Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE)]].

#### Electrostatic Force
This is the force of attraction or repulsion between two or more electrically charged bodies. This force is exerted indirectly through a field.

The study of electrostatic forces is covered in [[Electrostatics]].

#### Magnetic Force
This is the force *exerted by a magnetic field* upon a magnetic pole placed in it. It is an *Attractive or Repulsive* force. 

We further study magnetic force in [[magnetism]]. 

### Contact Forces
We look at 4 types of contact forces
- Applied force
- Normal force
- Friction Force
- Tension force

#### Applied Force
Applied forces are forces that work directly on a person that is done by another object. 

#### Normal Force
The normal force is a force that is applied perpendicularly on any object that rests on a surface. The surface applies a force to anything that is in contact with it. 

#### Friction Force
Friction is the force with opposes the movement of an object. 

Friction has to do with the transfer of Electrons on static objects, and is a part of [[Electrostatics#Triboelectric charging through friction]].

#### Tension Force
Tension force is the force applied on an object that is transmitted through string, rope, cable, or wire when it is pulled tight on both ends. 

Tension force is the basis of what allows pendulums to work. 

## Effects of Forces on Objects
When forces are applied to objects the objects will undergo one of three effects:
- Distortion – a change in shape
- Change in motion – speeding up or slowing down ([[Acceleration (a)]])
- Change in direction – change of direction that a force will move. 

## Representing Forces
Force diagrams consist of:
- an origin
- Force lines in the direction the force is applied
- Force labels
	- Type of force
	- Magnitude of force
