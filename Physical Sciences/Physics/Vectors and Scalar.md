# Vectors and Scalars

**Vector Definition**: a quantity that has both magnitude and direction

**Scalar Definition**: a quantity that has only magnitude

**Resultant Vector Definition**: a single vector that has the same effect as a number of vectors acting together

## Working with Vectors
Vectors cannot be added and subtracted normally, because we must account for their direction. As such, we can used [[Vector Operations]], where we break vectors down into the x-plane and y-plane using [[Trigonometry]]. 

## Representing Vectors
### The vector sign
$\vec{F}$ is the sign for vectors
