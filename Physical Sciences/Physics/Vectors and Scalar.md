# Vectors and Scalars
**Vector Definition**: a quantity that has both magnitude and direction

**Scalar Definition**: a quantity that has only magnitude

**Resultant Vector Definition**: a single vector that has the same effect as a number of vectors acting together

## Representing Vectors
### The vector sign

$\vec{F}$ is the sign for vectors

## Finding the Components of a Vector
We can use [[trigonometry]] to find the $x$ and $y$ components of a vector. This can be used to add many vectors mathematically, with no upper limit to the amount that can be added. 

The general formula for this is made of two parts, finding the X-component and finding the Y-component. To do this, we use trigonometry to find the ratio between two unknown sides, and multiply that ratio by the magnitude of the force (the hypotenuse) to get the magnitude of one of the sides.

$$\begin{align}
\\ && F_c = F_m \cos(\theta) \textrm{or} F_m \sin(\theta)
\\ & \textrm{Where: }
\\ & F_c = && \textrm{Component of Force } (N ; \degree)
\\ & F_c = && \textrm{Component of Force } (N ; \degree)
\end{align}$$

Whether $\sin$ or $\cos$ are used depends on the position of $\theta$ compared to the X and Y axis, but by using $\sin = \frac{o}{h}$ and $\cos = \frac{a}{h}$ (soh; cah) we can figure out which one to use.

> $$\begin{align}
 \\ && F_1 = 300N ; 34\degree
 \\ & F_{1x} = 300\cos(34\degree) = 248,71N left 
 \\ & F_{1y} = 300\sin(34\degree) = 167,75N up
 \end{align}$$
