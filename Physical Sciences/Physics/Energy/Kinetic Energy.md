# Kinetic Energy
**Definition**: The energy an object possesses because of itâ€™s motion ^definition

**Unit of Measure**: joules (J)

## Formula:
$$\begin{align}
\\ && E_K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2

\\ & Where:
\\ & E_K = && \textrm{Kinetic Energy } (J)
\\ & m = && \textrm{mass } (Kg)
\\ & v = && \textrm{velocity } (m.s^{-1})
\end{align}$$
> [[Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE)#Weight and GPE|Mass]]; [[Velocity (v)]] 


## Explanation
Kinetic Energy depends on mass and velocity. As mass increases, then the object not only requires more energy to move, but also has more [[Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE)]] applied to it. As velocity increases, then the object is moving faster and with more energy.  ^blurb
