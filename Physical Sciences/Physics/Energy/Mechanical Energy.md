# Mechanical Energy
**Definition**: Total amount of energy in a system. ^definition

**Unit of Measure**: Joules (J)

## Formula:
$$\begin{gather}
\\& E_T = E_P + E_K
\\
\\& Where:
\\& E_T = \textrm{Total Energy } (J)
\\& E_P = \textrm{Potential Energy } (J)
\\& E_K = \textrm{Kinetic Energy } (J)
\end{gather}$$
> [[Energy#Potential Energy]]; [[Energy#Kinetic Energy]]



## Components of Mechanical Energy
When talking about mechanical energy we mainly deal with [[Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE)]] and [[Kinetic Energy]] ^blurb

![[Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE)]]

![[Kinetic Energy]]

## The Law of Conservation of Energy
Mechanical energy relies on the law of conservation of energy for the statement $E_T = E_P + E_K$, as this means that the initial energy of a system will still be the same as the final energy if the system is closed. This allows us to transfer from [[Kinetic Energy]] to [[Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE)]] and vice-versa.
