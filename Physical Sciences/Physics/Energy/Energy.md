# Forms of Energy
Energy is the ability for something to do work. The more energy an object possesses, the more work can be done by that object. ^blurb

**Definition**: the ability of an object or substance to do work ^definition

**Unit of Measure**: Joules (J)

## Types of energy:
There are 2 forms of energy; Kinetic energy and potential energy. Within these there are subclasses of types of kinetic energy and types of potential energy. 

### Potential Energy
Potential energy is stored energy within an object, or energy possessed by an object because of it’s position within a field. 

Potential energy can be:
- Chemical Potential Energy – Energy stored in the [[Bonding|bonds]] between atoms and molecules
- Nuclear Potential Energy – energy stored in the [[Atoms#Nucleus of An atom - Protons and Neutrons|nucleus of an atom]]
- [[Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE)]] – energy an object possesses due to its position within a gravitational field
- Stored Mechanical Energy – energy stored in an object by the application of force that cannot be converted to kinetic energy

### Kinetic Energy
Kinetic energy is energy that is being actively used by an object. 

Kinetic energy can be:
- Kinetic energy – the energy possessed by objects in motion
- [[Longitudinal Waves|Sound]] Energy – energy associated with the vibration of matter
- Thermal Energy – The energy of heat that comes from the movement of particles within a substance
- [[Charge (Q)|Electrical Energy]] – the energy caused by moving electrical charges
