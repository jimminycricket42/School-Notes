# Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE)
**Definition**: Gravitational [[Energy#Potential Energy|potential energy]] is energy an object possesses because of its position in a gravitational field. ^definition

**Unit of Measure**: N

## Formula:
### Formula for weight:
$$\begin{align}
\\&  W = m \times g
\\ 
\\&  \textrm{Where: }
\\& W = \textrm{ Weight } (Newtons)
\\& m = \textrm{ Mass } (Kg)
\\& g = \textrm{ Gravitational Potential Energy }(N.Kg^{-1})
\end{align}$$

### Formula for Gravitational Potential energy
$$\begin{gather}
\\& E_p = mgh
\\
\\ Where:
\\ E_p = &\textrm{Potential Energy } (unitOfMeasure)
\\ m = &\textrm{mass } (Kg)
\\ g = &\textrm{Gravitational Acceleration } (m.s^{-2}) = 9,8m.s^{-2} \textrm{ on earth}
\\ h = &\textrm{height } (m)
\end{gather}$$
> [[#Gravitational Acceleration]]; [[Energy#Potential Energy]]

## Explanation
Gravitational Potential energy is the [[energy]] that is applied on all objects, especially by ones with high mass. The affect of gravitational potential [[Energy|potential energy]] on mass creates *weight*. ^blurb

Gravitational potential energy is linked to weight and height. As an object gets heavier, it experiences more pull from gravity. As it gets higher off the ground, the more it can [[Acceleration (a)|accelerate]] before hitting the ground. This means as weight and height increase, then gravitational potential energy increases. 

## Gravitational Fields
All objects with mass create a gravitational field. All objects within a gravitational field are affected by the gravitational field. 

- Weak gravitational fields exert very little force and are made by objects with very little mass. 
- Strong gravitational fields, such as the earth, exert a lot of force and have great mass. 

## Gravitational Acceleration
Objects within a strong gravitational field will experience gravitational acceleration if there is nothing to stop it from moving. This means that gravitational potential energy will be transferred into [[Kinetic Energy]]. 

> [!note]+ :spiral_notepad: Gravitational Acceleration on Earth
> On earth the gravitational acceleration is $9,8m/s^{-2}$, meaning that any object will [[Acceleration (a)|accelerate]] at $9,8m/s^{-1}$ if air resistance is ignored.
