# Acceleration (a)
**Definition**: The rate of change of [[Velocity (v)]] in a fixed period of time. ``^definition

**Unit of Measure**: meters per second squared ($m.s^{-2}$)

## Formula:
$$\begin{gather}
\\& a = \frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t}
\\
\\& Where:
\\& a = \textrm{acceleration } (ms.^{-2}, n\degree)
\\& \Delta \vec{v} = \textrm{change in instantaneous velocity } (ms.^{-1}, n\degree)
\\& \Delta t = \textrm{change in time } (s)
\end{gather}$$
> [[Velocity (v)]]


## Positive and Negative Acceleration
Positive acceleration is going faster, while negative acceleration is going slower. Positive acceleration moves in the same direction as the [[Displacement]] of the object, while negative acceleration moves in the opposite direction.
