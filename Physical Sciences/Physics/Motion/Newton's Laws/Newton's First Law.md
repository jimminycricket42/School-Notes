# Newton’s First Law
**Definition**: An object will continue in a state of rest or uniform motion unless a non-zero net force acts on it. ^definition



## Newton’s law and F<sub>net</sub>
An object that is moving will continue moving unless there is a force that causes it to stop. Similarly, an object requires a force to start moving, an will not start moving without a [[Net Force]] acting on it. In general, friction will cause an object to stop moving. If friction were not present, objects always continue moving. 
We can use this information to calculate the magnitude of other forces when motion is uniform or when an object is at rest.

## Inertia
The tendency of an object to keep moving is known as inertia. [[Mass]] is a measure of inertia, which can be seen with heavier objects being harder to move than lighter objects.
