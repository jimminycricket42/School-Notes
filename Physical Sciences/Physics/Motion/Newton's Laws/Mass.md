# Mass
**Definition**: The amount of matter in something: a quantitative measure of [[inertia]] ^definition

**Unit of Measure**: kilograms (kg)

## Formula:
$$\begin{align}
\\ && m = \frac{W}{g}
\\ & \textrm{Where: }
\\ & m = && \textrm{mass} (kg)
\\ & W = && \textrm{weight} (N)
\\ & g = && \textrm{gravity } (m.s^{-1})
\end{align}$$
> [[Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE)|Weight and Gravity]]; 

## Inertia
The tendency of an object to keep moving is known as inertia. [[Mass]] is a measure of inertia, which can be seen with heavier objects being harder to move than lighter objects.
