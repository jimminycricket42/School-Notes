# Newton's Second Law
**Definition**: When a Net force is applied to an object, the object accelerates in the direction of the applied force. The acceleration is directly proportional to the net force and inversely proportional to the mass. ^definition

$$\begin{align}
\\ & \textrm{Where: }
\\ & \vec{a} = && \textrm{Acceleration } (m.s^{-2})
\\ & \vec{F}_{net} = && \textrm{Net Force } (N)
\\ & m = && \textrm{Mass } (kg)
\end{align}$$
> [[Mass]]; [[Forces]]; [[Acceleration (a)]]

## Newtons Law and Acceleration
Newtonâ€™s first law tells us that acceleration occurs in the same direction as the net force. The second law tells us the magnitude of acceleration is directly proportional to $\vec{F}_{net}$and indirectly proportionate to weight.

$$
\vec{a} \propto m^{-1}
$$
> In words: acceleration is directly proportional to the inverse of mass, therefore it is inversely proportional to mass

$$
\vec{a} \propto \vec{F}_{net}
$$
> In words: Acceleration is directly proportional to $\vec{F}_{net}$
