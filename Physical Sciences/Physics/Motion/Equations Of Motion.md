# Equations Of Motion
There are 3 equations of motion that we can use to analyse motion.

These equations are:
- Graph of position and time
- Graph of [[Velocity (v)]] and Time
- Graph of [[Acceleration (a)]] and Time

## Graph of Position and Time

> [!note] :spiral_notepad: The Gradient of a position time graph
> In a position-time graph, the [[gradient]] of the graph is the velocity, as the gradient would be $\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$ This also means that if the gradient is 0, then the object is stationary. 

## Graph of Velocity and Time

> [!note]+ :spiral_notepad: The Area beneath the Velocity-Time graph 
> In a velocity-time graph, the area underneath the graph would be $v \times s$, meaning it is the distance travelled by the object. 

> [!note]+ :spiral_notepad: The Gradient of a Velocity-Time graph
> In a Velocity-Time graph, the [[gradient]] of the graph is the acceleration, as the gradient would be $\frac{\Delta \vec{v}}{\Delta t}$ This also means that if the gradient is 0, then the acceleration is constant. 

## Graph of Acceleration and Time

> [!note]+ :spiral_notepad: The Area beneath the Acceleration-Time graph 
> In a Acceleration-time graph, the area underneath the graph would be $\vec{a} \times s$, meaning it is the average velocity of the object. 

> [!note]+ :spiral_notepad: The Gradient of a Acceleration-Time graph
> In a Acceleration-Time graph, the [[gradient]] of the graph is the velocity, as the gradient would be $\frac{\Delta \vec{a}}{\Delta t}$.
