# Motion in one Dimension
Movement can be thought of a combination of many different factors in order to describe how an object has changed position. Movement has many components, including direction, distance, speed, velocity, acceleration, and more. ^blurb

## Components of Motion
We look at:
- Frames of reference
- position
- Direction
- Distance and displacement

### Frames of Reference
A frame of reference is what *allows us to measure* distance, displacement, speed, and velocity, as without a frame of reference we would not know where to start measuring from. A frame of reference is often the *origin point of a movement*. We can use the symbol $O$ for origin point. 

If we place our origin point on a graph then we can assign coordinate positions to our origin, as well as any motion that occurs from there. This can be put into a [[Vectors and Scalar#Vector Diagrams]].

> [[Coordinates]] on a map are the same thing, they show our position on earth if we were to treat the surface of the earth like a flat surface. 

### Position
Position is the place that an object can be found. We can represent position using $x$. 

### Direction
Direction is the position of a point in reference to an origin. We can display this using $n\degree$

## Measuring Motion
To measure the motion of an object, we use [[Distance and Displacement]].

## Change in Motion
The change in motion is described by speed and velocity
