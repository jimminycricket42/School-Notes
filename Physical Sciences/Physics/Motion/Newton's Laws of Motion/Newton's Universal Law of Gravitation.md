# Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation
 ^blurb

> [!definition]
> **Newtonâ€™s Universal Law of Gravitation**: Each body in the universe attracts every other body with a force that is directly proportional to the products of their masses and is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
> 
> **Formula**:
> $$\begin{align}
> \\ & F = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}
> \\ & \textrm{Where: }
> \\ F & =\textrm{Force } (N)
> \\ m_1 & =\textrm{Mass of object 1 } (Kg)
> \\ m_2 & =\textrm{Mass of object 2 } (Kg)
> \\ r & =\textrm{ Distance between the two objects } (m)
> \\ G & =\textrm{Universal Gravitational Constant } = 6,67 \times 10^-11 (N.m^2.kg^{-2})
> \end{align}$$

> F \propto \frac{1}{r^2}

## Weightlessness
Weightlessness is when only the force of gravity is acting on an object.
