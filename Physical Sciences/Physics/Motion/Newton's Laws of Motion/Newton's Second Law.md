# Newton's Second Law
Newton’s second law dictates how an objects motion changes when a net force is applied. It states that $\vec{a} \propto F$ and $\vec{a} \propto \frac{1}{m}$.

> **Newton’s Second Law**: When a *non-zero net force is* applied to an object, the object *accelerates in the direction of the applied force*. The acceleration is *directly proportional to the net force* and *inversely proportional to the mass*.

## Newtons Law and Acceleration
Newton’s first law tells us that acceleration occurs in the same direction as the net force. The second law tells us the magnitude of acceleration is directly proportional to $\vec{F}_{net}$ and indirectly proportionate to weight.

$$
\vec{a} \propto m^{-1}
$$
> In words: acceleration is directly proportional to the inverse of mass, therefore it is inversely proportional to mass

$$
\vec{a} \propto \vec{F}_{net}
$$
> In words: Acceleration is directly proportional to $\vec{F}_{net}$

## Applications of Newton’s Second Law
We look at:
- [[#Objects moving on a flat surface]]
- [[#Objects moving on a sloped surface]]
- [[#Connected objects moving together on a surface]]
- [[#Objects being lifted by a line]]

### Objects moving on a flat surface
With objects moving on a flat surface we have to focus on the  mass and the forces acting in the horizontal plane. 
Often in these scenarios, the vertical forces ($F_g, F_N, F_{ay}$) will cancel out, but you must still check if they do. 

> [!note] Approaching one of these problems
In general, working out the Net Force is a high priority. It allows you to work out other forces, or the acceleration and mass. There are two formulae you can do this with:

> $\vec{F}_{net} = F_A + (-F_f)$

> **Q**: A block of $2kg$ is pulled by a $4N \space\textrm{Left}$ force and a $10N \space \textrm{right}$ force. The block accelerates $2m.s^{-2} right$, what is the frictional force applied on the block?

### Objects moving on a sloped surface
To work with objects moving on a sloped surface, we must first [[Vector Operations|decompose]] the force into it’s x- and y- components. 

### Connected objects moving together on a surface


### Objects being lifted by a line
