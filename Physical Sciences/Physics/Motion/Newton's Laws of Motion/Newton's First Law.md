# Newton’s First Law
An object will not change it’s motion without an external force acting on it. This property is known as [[Mass (m)|Inertia]].

## Newton’s law and $\vec{F}_{net}$
An object will not begin to accelerate without some force acting on it. This is made apparent by a ball on a flat surface, or any other stationary object. Once the object has been pushed, it begins to accelerate in the same direction as the force. This interaction is described more in [[Newton's Second Law]]. 

Similarly, a moving object with no net force will continue moving until another net force stops it. Think of a ball rolling down a hill, if the slope is gentle the ball may stop, but if it is steep the ball will accelerate. If the slope is just right, the ball with move with a constant velocity because the gravitational force and frictional force cancel each other out. 

We can use this information to calculate the magnitude of other forces when motion is uniform or when an object is at rest.

> **A**: $\vec{V}$ is constant, meaning $a = 0m.s^{-2}$, therefore $F_{net} = 0N$

> [!example]+ Using Newton’s First Law with Force to find Acceleration
> **Q**: A block is pushed with $\vec{F}_{a1} = 10N \textrm{ Left}$ and $\vec{F}_{a2}  = 4N \textrm{ Right}$  . It encounters $6N$ of friction. Describe the block’s motion.

## Inertia
The tendency of an object to keep moving is known as inertia. [[Mass (m)]] is a measure of inertia, which can be seen with heavier objects being harder to move than lighter objects. 

If two objects are travelling together at the same speed, and one has a change in motion, the other will not experience this change of motion if the object is not attached. This leads to two objects travelling at different speeds, and potentially in different scenarios. We can apply this knowledge to scenario’s like trains or car-crashes to explain why someone in a train might stumble if the train slows down, or why someone is flung within the car if they are not wearing a seatbelt.
