# The Rock Cycle
Rocks change over millions of years. They shift from one form to another, going from igneous to sedimentary to metamorphic rocks and back.

## Formation of Igneous rocks
Magma from below the [[Structure of the Earth#The Mantle|mantle]] rises to the surface and cools to create [[Igneous Rocks]].

## Formation of Sedimentary rocks
[[Sedimentary Rocks]] are made from [[Weathering|weathered]] rocks that are [[Deposition|deposited]] in layers and are compacted and cemented over time. 

## Formation of Metamorphic rocks
Metamorphic rocks are rocks that have changed from their original form to create a new kind of rock. Pressure and heat cause the chemical changes that transform [[Sedimentary Rocks]] into [[Metamorphic Rocks]]
