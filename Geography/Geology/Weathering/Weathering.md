# Weathering
#GR9 #geology/processes/weathering

Weathering is the breaking down and wearing away of rocks and soil by water, temperature changes, chemicals or plants and animals. ^44df2a

There are three different types of weathering;
-   Mechanical
-   Chemical
-   biological
    
## Mechanical (Physical) Weathering
Mechanical weathering occurs as a result of temperature or water affection the erosion of soil and rock.

### Frost shattering
Frost shattering (or freeze-thaw action) occurs when the temperature in an area drops below freezing, causing rocks to heat up and expand before cooling and shrinking. This causes water to fill the cracks. The water will then freeze and thaw, widening the cracks.

### Onion weathering
The same heating and coding can cause exfoliation of rocks. During the day, the temperature of the rock face heats up, and at night it drops rapidly. Eventually it breaks off the rest of the rock, and the surface of the rock "Peels off".

This can also be called onion weathering.

## Chemical weathering
The chemical composition of rock can change and cause rocks to weaken and break. Chemical reactions can naturally occur and weaken rock. Carbonation, hydrolysis, and oxidisation are common forms of chemical weathering.

### Carbonation
Acid rain causes carbonation within rocks. When rain absorbs carbon dioxide it becomes acid rain, and this reacts with rocks that contain calcium carbonate, causing a chemical reaction. The calcium carbonate becomes calcium bicarbonate, a soluble material, and then those parts of the rock are washed away with the rain. This creates grooves in the rocks that deepen and widen over time.

### Hydrolysis
Hydrolysis is when silicates absorb water and become clay. Silicates are special kinds of minerals that can absorb water. The clay will then easily be washed away and leave rocks unstable, leading to them crumbling.

### Oxidation
Oxidation commonly occurs in rocks containing iron. Rust is a form of oxidation on metal objects that get wet. This can happen on rocks, and leads to parts of the rock weakening, and turning red.

## Biological weathering
Plants push down into the rock and soil, breaking them apart. Animals also burrow into the ground, which weakens the soil and rocks. Many animals live underground, such as rabbits, snakes, earthworms, or moles. Trees are also extremely strong, and their roots have no issues breaking apart rocks.

Lichen are a type of plant that grows on rocks and secretes an acid that breaks down rock, the roots then penetrate the cracks to loosen the grains of rock. They are an example of both chemical and biological weathering

## Humans Speed up Weathering
Weathering happens naturally but is sped up by human activities.  
- *Construction* –when people clear vegetation and dig into the ground to lay foundations for buildings, they are increasing the rate of physical (mechanical) weathering that occurs in the area. They expose rocks from deeper underground that would otherwise not be subject to weathering. While building, chemicals are released into the soil which can contribute to chemical weathering. Fires that may be built by workers can also change the chemical composition of the soil, causing chemical weathering. Underground tunnels weaken the surrounding rock. 
- *Agriculture* –deforestation or removal of natural vegetation to make space for farms increases physical (mechanical) weathering in an area. Animals on farms can contribute to biological weathering. 
- *Pollution* –air pollution caused by manufacturing and cars results in high levels of acid rain. Chemicals are also released into water (in rivers or lakes) which changes the chemical composition of the water. This will result in chemical weathering occurring where it previously did not.
