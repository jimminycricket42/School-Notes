# Weathering, erosion, and deposition
#GR9 #geology/processes/weathering #geology/processes/erosion #geology/processes/deposition 

[[Weathering]], erosion, and deposition are all linked processes that create the natural features we see in the world.

[[Weathering]] and [[erosion]] is the wearing away of land.

[[Deposition]] is the building up of land, using the material produced from [[Weathering]] and erosion.

## [[Weathering]]
This Breaking down of rocks and soil that occurs in one place. There is little movement other than the loose material falling under the force of gravity.

Methods of [[Weathering]]:
-   Mechanical
    -   Exfoliation
    -   Freeze thaw
-   Chemical
    -   Oxidation
    -   Carbonation
    -   Hydrolysis
-   Biological

## Erosion
Erosion is the [[Weathering]] away of natural land by natural movement. Things like rivers, wind, or ice break down soil and rocks and allows them to move.

Agents/causes:
-   Water
-   Wind
-   Ice

## Deposition
[[Weathering]] and erosion produce rocks, sand, and soil, which is then deposited in places on land. This process is known as deposition. The materials are deposited by nature to create features of deposition.

Features of deposition:
-   Sand dunes
-   Scree slopes
-   Beaches
-   River deltas

## Causes of Erosion and Deposition
### Rivers
Rivers are flowing bodies of water that move downhill. Rivers carry weathered material from the river’s source to it’s mouth. The mouth of the river is where the river meets the ocean.

Over the course of a river, the water will pick up a load of silt and weathered materials. The faster the river the larger load it can hold.

#### Areas of the River and Related Features
Rivers are fed by tributaries, which are smaller rivers that connect to a larger river.
Next to the river are flood plains, which are often flooded in heavy rains. Near the river mouth deltas form to create small islands.
