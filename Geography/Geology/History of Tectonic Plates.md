# History of Tectonic Plates
in 1912 *Alfred Wegner* proposed the theory of *continental drift*, in which he stated that the continents of [[The Globe]] have been floating apart for millions of years. He also stated that the continents were once large landmass named Pangea.

> Pangea is Greek for “all land”

> [!info] What came after Pangaea?
> Pangea split into two, called Laurasia and Gondwanaland that then split into our modern continents

## Evidence for Continental Drift
We can look at: [[Fossils]], Mountain ranges, and Ocean floor spreading as evidence for continental drift
### Fossils
The discovery of certain species of [[fossils]] on different continents is evidence for continental drift

### Mountain Ranges
Geologists plotted the locations of old mountains and saw that they lined up in terms of their positions on Pangaea. Additionally, the same rock age and rock type was found in these ancient mountain ranges.

### Ocean Floor Spreading
The Atlantic ocean did not exist when the continents formed Pangaea, and we can now measure that it is getting wider. This is called ocean floor spreading, and we discuss this in depth in [[Tectonic Plates]].
