# Volcanoes
#GR10/Q2 #geology/natural-disasters 

Volcanoes are areas where there are *extrusive* volcanic activity, where magma reaches the earth’s surface and becomes lava. 

> [!info] Info
> Intrusive volcanic activity also occurs and can form, and we look at them as [[Igneous Rocks]]

## Types of Volcanoes
We look at active, dormant, and extinct volcanoes

 ### Active Volcanoes
 Active volcanoes are still erupting 
 ### Dormant Volcanoes
 Dormant Volcanoes are resting, they have not erupted for a long time, but they still might
 ### Extinct Volcanoes
 Extinct Volcanoes have not erupted in so long that scientists believe they will never erupt again

## Structure of Volcanoes
The structure of volcanoes depends on the material the volcano ejects. Volcanoes can eject:
- Lava
- Rocks
- Volcanic ash
- Steam
- Gases
	- Sulphur Dioxide
	- Carbon Dioxide
	- Nitrogen

In general, Volcanoes have a *magma reservoir* that travels through a *pipe* to a *vent* where the magma is extruded as lava. However, this can happen in many ways, and we classify different structures of volcanoes according to their pipes and cone layout. Specifically, we look at Composite volcanoes, Cinder Cone volcanoes, Shield Volcanoes, dome Volcanoes, and Caldera's

### Composite Volcanoes
Composite volcanoes are the most common, and they consist of a magma reservoir with many branching pipes that travel through layers of cooled lava and compacted ash. These volcanoes grow when they erupt, and they can grow to be 2500m high.

### Cinder Cone Volcanoes
Cinder Cone Volcanoes are built of hardened fragments of lava which are ejected *from a single vent*. When it erupts, it erupts violently and it sends droplets of lava into the air that cool to form small fragments of volcanic rock, called *cinders*. Sometimes the explosions can form *fissures* in the ground.

### Shield Volcanoes
Shield Volcanoes form when lava is hot and fluid. The lava flows through many vents to form different layers of volcanic rock that can be kilometres wide. Each time the volcano erupts, the lava plateau gets bigger and bigger. 
>[!info] Fun Fact
>The Drakensberg mountains is a dormant shield volcano that formed a basalt layer that is 1300m thick

### Lava Dome
Lava domes are relatively small masses of lava which is thick, causing It to move slowly and cool as it moves, causing a bulbous shape on the earth’s surface

### Caldera's
Calderas form when a volcano has not formed for a long time. This allows rock to harden in the vent of the caldera, that ‘plugs’ the volcano. This causes a buildup in pressure, that eventually blows the top of the volcano off, causing a massive crater that can fill with water.

## Locations of Volcanos
Volcanos often form around the tectonic plates, as this is where *lava* pushes up through the earth.

## Affects of Volcanos
### Positive Effects
- Volcanic Ash can be a fertiliser for soil
- Hot springs and Geysers that form near volcanoes are tourist attractions
- Underground water in volcanic regions can be hot enough to use for heating or electricity generation 

### Negative Effects
- Lava flows burn nearby vegetation and buildings
- Ash and lava can cover buildings and smother vegetation
- Ash and hardened lava can injure or kill people
- Tremors caused by volcanos can cause landslides
