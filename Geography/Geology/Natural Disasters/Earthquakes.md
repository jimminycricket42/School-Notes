# Earthquakes
#GR10/Q2 #geology

Earthquakes are vibrations of the earth that are caused by the [[tectonic plates]]. Plate movements cause faults in the earth’s crust that create *tectonic stresses*, which in turn create the *vibrations*. 
We can’t prevent earthquakes, but we can predict them and prepare. 

## Characteristics of an Earthquake
We look at the *focus*, the *epicentre*, and *Seismic waves*
### Focus
The focus is the point deep in the earth from which the earthquake begins. We normally find this foci between 70km to 700km below the earth’s surface. 

### Epicentre
The epicentre is the point *on the earth’s surface* immediately above the focus. This area suffers the worst damage during the earthquake.

### Seismic Waves
We look at two different types of Seismic wave: *P, S and L waves.* All waves start at the [[#focus]] and travel outwards, causing havoc and destruction
#### P and S waves
We group P and S waves because they both travel under the ground. 
#### L waves 
L waves travel on the surface, and are the waves that damage our buildings. 

## Measuring Earthquakes
We use a *seismograph* to measure earthquakes according to the *Richter Scale*. The Richter Scale is a scale from 1 - 9, with each step representing a magnitude of 10x the amount of the previous step. The Richter scale measures *the damage done by an earthquake*.  ^34574c

| Magnitude | Damage                                                                 |
| --------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| > 2.5     | Micro earthquakes - Humans don’t feel them but seismographs do         |
| 2.5 → 4.5 | Humans feel these quakes, but they cause very little damage            |
| 5.5 → 6.0 | Cars and houses shake, windows crack                                   |
| 6.1 → 6.6 | Old and poorly-built buildings may collapse, houses may sustain damage |
| 8.0 <     | Total Destruction                                                                       |

## Affects of earthquakes
- [[Tsunami’s]] are caused by earthquakes
- Destruction of buildings and infrastructure
- Destruction of habitats and wildlife

## Predicting Earthquakes
We cannot prevent earthquakes, but we can predict and prepare. To predict, we can look at:
- Satellite information
- Animal warning Signals
- Laser Beams and Seismographs

### Satellite Information
Satellites that orbit the earth can scan for rising magma that may cause plate movements, as well as changes in temperature on the earth surface. They can then use these two to accurately predict earthquakes

### Animal warning Signals
Animals tend to behave strangely just before an earthquake. This is because they are more sensitive to the vibrations than humans are. This can be a few minutes warning that can help us quickly protect ourselves.

### Laser Beams and Seismographs
Laser beams can be used to measure the movement of the tectonic plates, and to predict possible seismic events.[[#^34574c|seismograps]] are also very useful, as they can give us a warning for the earthquake to come.
