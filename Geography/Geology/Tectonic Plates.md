# Tectonic Plates
Heat from the [[Structure of the Earth#The Mantle|the mantle]] deforms rocks and breaks them into large sections known as *tectonic plates*. These plates carry our continents and our oceans and cause [[History of Tectonic Plates#Evidence for Continental Drift|Continental Drift]], as well as [[Earthquakes]] and [[Volcanoes]].

## Types of Tectonic plates
We look at Terrestrial and Continental Tectonic Plates
### Continental Tectonic plates
These plates can contain land and ocean, but must contain land. These are involved in [[#Fold Mountains|Fold Mountain]]
### Oceanic Tectonic Plates
These plates only contain ocean. They are involved in subduction zones and ocean floor spreading. 

## Movement of the Tectonic plates
As heat rises from [[Structure of the Earth|core]] of the earth into the [[Structure of the Earth|mantle]], it causes [[Convection Currents]] to form into *convection cells*, which in turn move the plates that float on the [[Structure of the Earth|crust]] of the earth.

## Plate Boundaries
On the map of tectonic plates, we see that there are arrows where the plates meet. These arrows denote the movement of the tectonic plates relative to each other. We classify three different types of movement:
- Convergent/Destructive
- Transverse/Passive
- Divergent/Constructive

### Convergent Plate Boundaries
Convergent plates move toward each other, which forces the lighter plate upwards (we say it has been uplifted) and the heavier plate downwards. This creates [[#Fold Mountains|Fold Mountains]] as well as [[#Oceanic Trenches|Oceanic Trenches]]. The heavier rock is forced into the [[Structure of the Earth|mantle]] where it is melted into magma, which gives it the name ‘destructive plate boundaries’

### Transverse Plate Boundaries
Transverse plates move alongside each other. These plate boundaries undergo a lot of movement, making [[Earthquakes]] common along them. Rock is neither uplifted nor destroyed here, giving it the name passive.

### Divergent Plate Boundaries
Divergent plates move away from each other. These plate boundaries split open the earth, allowing magma to rise and cool. This causes [[#Ocean Floor Spreading|Ocean Floor Spreading]], and forms a part of [[The Rock Cycle]]. This is the creation of [[Igneous Rocks]], giving it its alternate name, Constructive Plate Boundaries.

## Landforms associated with Plate Boundaries
We look at [[Rock folding and Faulting#Fold Mountains|Fold Mountains]], Oceanic trenches, and Ocean floor Spreading

### Fold Mountains
Fold mountains occur at convergent plate boundaries with at least one continental plate, where lighter rock is uplifted into mountains and denser rock is sent into the [[Structure of the Earth|mantle]].

### Oceanic Trenches
Oceanic Trenches occur along *convergent plate boundaries* where a *continental* and *oceanic* plate converge, causing a *subduction zone* to form where the oceanic plate goes under the continental plate and causes a large trench.

### Ocean Floor Spreading and Mid-Oceanic Ridges
Mid-oceanic ridges occur along *divergent plate boundaries* where *two oceanic plates*. The plates pull apart, causing magma to rise and turn into [[Igneous Rocks]]. 

This new land further pushes the plates apart, causing the ocean floor to grow and spread.

At the boundary, magma rises to the surface, creating underwater [[Volcanoes]] that slowly form a new band of land known as an oceanic ridge. 

These two factors, the diverging of plates and the formation of the oceanic ridge, causes [[History of Tectonic Plates#Evidence for Continental Drift|Continental Drift]]
