# Igneous Rocks
Igneous means fiery, and igneous rocks are formed when magma becomes solid. This causes them to have a unique structure with interesting characteristics. 

## Formation of Igneous Rocks
There are two types of Igneous rocks that form, Intrusive igneous rocks and Extrusive Igneous rocks. These rocks have different structures based on their *rate of cooling*, for instance, a igneous rock that cooled quickly will have small crystals present, and an igneous rock that cools slowly forms large crystals.

### Intrusive igneous rocks
When there is a weakness in the Earth's crust, pressure forces magma to travel up the fault. This forms an *igneous intrusion* that eventually cools to form extrusive igneous rock. 
### Extrusive Igneous Rocks
When magma flows onto the surface as *Lava*  and cools to form extrusive igneous rock. 

## Characteristics of Igneous rocks
All Igneous rocks are *crystalline*. This is due to silica, iron, and magnesium found in the rocks that form crystalline structures as they cool. If the magma cools too quickly, these crystals are small, but if it cools slowly it can form large crystals. They are also *massive*, meaning they are one solid mass without distinct layers. 

## Types of Igneous Rocks
- Granite
- Basalt
- Dolerite
- Kimberlite

## Uses of Igneous Rocks
Igneous rocks are very useful, they contain valuable materials such as copper, gold, iron, and manganese. They are also very hard, which allows them to be used for building roads and reinforcing concrete

## Formations associated with igneous rocks
Igneous rocks can form two types of features: Igneous intrusions and Landforms. 

### Igneous Intrusions
We look at: Batholith, Laccoliths, Lopoliths, Sills, Dykes, Volcanic Pipes, and Monoliths

#### Batholiths
Batholiths are large hollow filled with magma that forms deep under the surface. It allows the magma to cool slowly.

#### Laccoliths
Laccoliths are mushroom-shaped structures that forms when magma pushed the overlying rocks upwards.

#### Lopoliths
Lopoliths are similar to a laccolith, but the overlying rock is too heavy to be pushed, forcing the magma downwards instead.

#### Sills
Sills form where magma intrudes horizontally *between* layers of rocks

#### Dykes
Dykes are when magma intrudes *vertically* across layers of rocks

#### Volcanic Pipes
Volcanic pipes are deep, carrot-shaped pipes of solidified magma that can normally reach the surface. Diamonds are often found in Volcanic Pipes, as they form *kimberlite*

#### Monoliths
Monoliths are very, very large igneous intrusions that form quite near to  [[Structure of the Earth#The Mantle|the mantle]]. It can also be classified as a batholith.

### Igneous Extrusions
#### Dome Mountains
Dome Mountains are formed by batholiths when the rock surrounding them is worn away. They can be thousands of kilometres in size.

#### Mesas
Mesas are formed by sills that protect the weaker rock beneath them, forming flat-topped mountains with soft rock underneath hard rock

#### Buttes
Buttes are formed as Mesas erode until the vertical height is greater than the horizontal area.

#### Conical Hills
Conical hills are formed by extreme erosion of buttes, until the hard rock on top is worn away.
