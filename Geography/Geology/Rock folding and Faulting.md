# Rock folding and Faulting
# Rock Folding and Faulting


Rocks change shape when strong forces apply *compressional forces* to the rock. If the forces aren’t too strong, the rock merely warp. If the forces are stronger, we call it folding or faulting. Forces strong enough to fault rocks occur at [[History of Tectonic Plates|convergent plate boundaries]]  

## Folding
Folding is when the rock’s shape changes without it breaking. This causes higher and lower laying land. We call higher land anticlines and lower land synclines, and the areas that join the two are known as folds
### Types of fold
- Symmetrical 
- Asymmetrical
- Overfold
- Overthrust Fracture

%%TODO: make a diagram about the types of folds%%
### Landforms Associated with Folds
#### Fold Mountains

## Faulting
Faulting occurs when rock breaks due to the movement of [[Tectonic Plates]]
### Types of Faults
- Normal – occurs at [[History of Tectonic Plates|divergent plate boundaries]]
- Reverse – occurs at [[History of Tectonic Plates|convergent plate boundaries]]
- Transform – [[History of Tectonic Plates|transverse plate boundaries]]
