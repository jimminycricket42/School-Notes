# Metamorphic Rocks
Metamorphic rocks are rocks that undergone a change. 

## Formation of Metamorphic Rocks
Metamorphic Rocks are made when [[Sedimentary Rocks]] and [[Igneous Rocks]] are put under heat a and pressure to undergo a transformation. 

## Characteristics
Metamorphic rocks have a combination of the properties of igneous and sedimentary rocks, such as crystals forming in layers. 

## Types of Metamorphic Rocks
| Original Rock | Metamorphic Rock |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| Sandstone     | Quartzite        |
| Limestone     | Marble           |
| Shale         | Slate            |
| Granite       | Gneiss           |

## Uses of Metamorphic Rocks
Metamorphic rocks can contain metals and minerals. They are the hardest type of rock, which allows them to be used in the construction of roads and buildings. Slate is useful for roofing, gneiss for roads, and marble for countertops as polished metamorphic rocks often look really nice. 

## Features associated with Metamorphic Rocks
### Metamorphic Escarpment
Very old rock formations forming plateau regions that look like a steep cliff along the edge of resistant strata.
