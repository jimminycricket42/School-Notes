# Structure of the Earth
When the Earth was formed, it started as a ball of gas and liquid. Over millions of years these gasses and liquids condensed into solids and molten rocks. The heavier materials like nickel and iron sunk to the centre, while the lighter elements rose. This formed four distinct layers: The inner core, the outer core, the mantle and the crust

## The Inner Core
The inner core consists of an extremely hot ball of metal that Is crushed into a solid ball despite the high temperature. It is around 1200km thick. 

## The Outer Core
The outer core consists of very dense molten rock that is around 2000km thick. 

## The Mantle
The mantle consists of *magma* â€” molten rock in a thick, plastic-like state. The mantle is around 2900km thick, and it is denser than the crust. The [[Tectonic Plates]] rest on top of this layer, where [[Convection Currents]] cause them to move, creating [[History of Tectonic Plates|continental drift]],  and [[Earthquakes]], as well as assisting [[The Rock Cycle]]. 

## The Crust
The crust consists of solid rock, and it is the layer that we live on. It is the least dense layer of the Earth. It is also the thinnest layer, ranging from 4km thick to 90km. The crust consists of oceanic and continental crust. The crust is also known as the *lithosphere*. The crust rests atop [[Tectonic Plates]] which allows it to move, causing [[Earthquakes]] and allowing [[Volcanoes]] to form. 

### Oceanic Crust
The oceanic crust is more dense than continental crust, and it is made of newer rock. It is 5-10km thick, and is typically made of basalt. 

### Continental Crust
The continental crust is less dense than Oceanic Crust, and it is made of older rock. It is between 30-60km thick, and is typically made of granite.
