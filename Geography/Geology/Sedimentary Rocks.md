# Sedimentary Rocks
#GR10/Q2 #geology/types-of-rocks #geology/land-formations
Sedimentary rocks are made up of layers of [[erosion|sediments]] that have been *compacted* and *cemented* to form *strata* (meaning layers). 

## Formation of Sedimentary Rocks
We look at two methods of formation for sedimentary rock: Mechanically formed Sedimentary Rock and Organically formed Sedimentary Rock

### Mechanically Formed Sedimentary Rock
Most sedimentary rocks are mechanically formed. They rely on [[Weathering, Erosion, and Deposition]] to create *sediments* that are [[Deposition]] deposited. 
eg. 
- Conglomerate
- Sandstone
- Shale

### Organically Formed Sedimentary Rock
Some sedimentary rocks are made up of the fossilized remains of plants an animals. 
- Limestone – formed from shells of marine organisms 
- Coal – formed by trees and plants that undergo heat and pressure

## Land formations associated with Sedimentary Rocks
### Sedimentary plateau
A flat landform of horizontal sedimentary rock which has been *uplifted*.

### Sedimentary Plain
A flat landform of horizontal sedimentary rock which is low-lying.

### Sedimentary Ridges and Valleys
Alternating layers of resistant and less resistant rock have been uplifted and folded, causing large [[Rock folding and Faulting#Fold Mountains|Fold Mountains]].
