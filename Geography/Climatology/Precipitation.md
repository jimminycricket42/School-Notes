# Precipitation
We look at:
- Dew and Frost
- Hail and Snow
- Rain

## Dew and Frost
Dew is *water* which collects on plants. Frost is *ice* that collects on plants. These occur when the surface cools to dew point. 
### Dew
Dew occurs when the temperature of dew point is above freezing and condenses into water. This can be very good for plants
### Frost
Frost occurs when the temperature of dew point is below freezing, and water vapour crystallizes into ice. This can be very damaging to plants. Frost pockets can form in valleys where cold air is forced into the centre by rising warmer air. 
## Hail and Snow
Snow occurs when it is very cold and dew point drops below 0. The water vapour crystalizes into tiny crystals that join together to form snowflakes. Often, these snowflakes melt before they reach the ground. 
Hail is a much harder form of precipitation. It can cause a lot of damage when the hailstones become large enough. Hail starts in updrafts in [[Formation Of Clouds|cumulonimbus clouds]] where there are winds greater than 180km/h. In cumulonimbi, you can find patches of air with different properties, such as humidity, as well as *supercooled water droplets*. These are droplets that are liquid, even though the temperature is below freezing. When a dust particle collides with these droplets, they form frozen raindrops that collide with other droplets until a larger hailstone is formed. This hailstone will grow until it becomes too heavy for the updrafts of the cloud to hold, so it falls to the earth as a large chunk of ice.

### Sleet
Sleet is a mixture of snow and rain 

## Rain
Rain is water that has fallen to the earth. We look at Three different types of rainfall:
- Relief rainfall
- Frontal Rainfall
- Convectional Rainfall

### Relief Rainfall
Relief rain forms when warm, moist air blows onto a mountain which forces it to rise. The rising air and water vapour then cool to dew point and forms clouds. This results in rain on the *windward side* of a slope, but not on the leeward side. We say the leeward side sits in the *rain shadow* of the mountain. 

### Frontal Rainfall
Frontal Rain Forms when warm air is forced to rise at a cold front, as the cold, denser air will force itself under the lighter warm air, forcing the warm air up. The warm air then rises until it cools down, and precipitation occurs. 

### Convectional Rainfall
Convectional Rain forms when the hot air expands and rises, forming [[Convection Currents]]. The rising air then cools and precipitation occurs as heavy rainfall and *thunderstorms*.
