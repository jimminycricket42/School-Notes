# Moisture in the Atmosphere
Water is vital to life on earth. Water is continuously recycled through [[The Water Cycle]].

## Forms of water in the atmosphere
We find water as:
- gas – water vapour
- liquid – rain and clouds
- solid – ice and snow

## Precipitation
Precipitation in the atmosphere either occurs as a liquid (rain/drizzle) or a solid (ice/snow). Small particles of water vapour *condensate* or *sublimate* onto *condensation nuclei* (such as dust or salt-crystals) until they are heavy enough to fall to the earth, creating weather. 

## Measuring how much water is in the atmosphere
To measure how much water is in the atmosphere, we look at 4 things:
- Water Vapour Capacity
- Actual Humidity
- Relative Humidity
- Dew Point

### Water Vapour Capacity
The amount of water that the air can hold is determined by it’s temperature, as the higher the temperature of the air, the more spaced out its molecules are, the more space there is for water vapour. We call the maximum amount of water air can hold it’s *water vapour capacity*. 

### Actual Humidity
We call the actual amount of water in the air Actual humidity, and it is represented as g/m<sup>3</sup>. When the air is ‘full’, as in there is no more space for water, we call the air *saturated*

### Relative Humidity
Relative humidity is the amount of water in the air relative to the actual humidity. This is represented as a percentage, and can be calculated as:
$$
\textrm{Relative Humidity (RH)} = \frac{\textrm{Actual Humidity}}{\textrm{Water Vapour Capacity}} \times 100
$$
When relative humidity reaches 100%, the air is full of water and becomes saturated.
Both the temperature of the air and the bound of evaporation and sublimation that occurs affect the relative humidity. 

### Dew Point
We call the *temperature* that the air will become saturated *dew point*. If the temperature of the air drops below dew point, condensation and precipitation occur. We call the altitude at which this happens *condensation level*.  ^17ef05
