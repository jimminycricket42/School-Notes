# Temperatures of different places in the world
There are 5 different factors that affect the temperature of a region:
- [[Coordinates|Latitude]]
- Altitude
- Ocean Currents
- Distance from the Ocean
- Aspect

## Latitude
The distance from the equator affects the amount of sun an area recieves due to the *tilt of the earth’s axis*. This causes temperatures closer to the equator to be warmer, and temperatures far from the equator to be colder. This is because of the *angle that the sun’s rays hit the earth*. 

![[Temperatures of different places in the world .excalidraw]]

As we can see above, we have an equal amount of *[[Heating of the Atmosphere|insolation]]* entering the earth at different points, but the radiation that enters closer to the poles has to travel through a longer portion of [[The Atmosphere|atmosphere]], and the actual energy is spread out over a larger area. This means that there is less energy for the area covered, making that area cooler than the equator. 

### The Influence of seasons
As we know, the sun is directly above different lines of [[Coordinates|latitude]] at different times of the year, causing the phonomena we call the seasons. The hottest band of [[Coordinates|latitude]] changes as the seasons change. We call this band the *heat equator*. The places closest to the heat equator are warmer than the places further away. 

Additionally, during Summer the days are longer than the nights, meaning an area will spend more time in the sun, absorbing more heat and getting warmer. The change in length of day also increases with distance from the equator, causing the north and south poles 6-month-nights, and further reducing/increasing the amount of time that an area has to soak up sunlight. 

## Altitude
Altitude refers to height above sea level, and as we know, temperatures decrease as you go higher up. This is because of how [[Heating of the Atmosphere#Heating of the atmosphere by the Earth|the atmosphere is heated by the earth]]. There is progressively less [[Heating of the Atmosphere#The Greenhouse Effect|greenhouse gases]] as we move up, meaning that less heat is absorbed. We call this rate of decrease the *environmental lapse rate*. The environmental lapse rate changes from day to day and from place to place, however, the amount with which the temperature in the [[The Atmosphere|troposphere]] decreases with height is *0.65°C for every 100m of altitude*. We call this the *positive lapse rate*

> If the temperature increases with altitude, we call it *temperature inversion*. We then refer to the amount by which the temperature increases as *negative lapse rate*.

## Ocean Currents
Air assumes the characteristics of the surface it is resting on. If it is sitting on a warm surface, the air is warm. If it is on a cold surface, it is cold. This becomes apparent when we look the effect of *ocean currents* on temperature. *Prevailing winds* that correspond with ocean currents blows air onto land, causing an increase or decrease in temperature depending on the type of ocean current

These currents can cause places that would otherwise be cold to be warmer, and can make meant-to-be-warm areas colder. They also play an important role in transferring heat from equatorial regions to the poles, aiding in the *heat balance* of the earth. 

## Distance from the Ocean
Water absorbs large amounts of *[[Heating of the Atmosphere|insolation]]* and releases it very slowly at night due to its translucent properties. This means that temperature ranges in areas near to the ocean are much smaller than temperature ranges far from the ocean. Not only is the *Diurnal* (Day/Night) range smaller, the seasonal range is also smaller. Areas close to the ocean have cooler summers and warmer winters, while areas far away have extreme heat in the summer and extreme cold in the winter. We call this *maritime* climate when near to the ocean or *continental* climate when far from the ocean. 

Water vs Land – heating

| Suns rays penetrate the transparent ocean, spreading the heat over a greater volume | Suns rays only have to heat a thin layer of ground |
| The Ocean has mobile currents that mixes hot and cold water                         | The land has no movement                           |
| Ocean reflects the suns energy                                                      | Land absorbs the suns energy                       |
| the specific heat of water is higher than lands                                     | the specific heat is lower than waters             |

## Aspect
Aspect is the direction that a slope faces. Slopes that face the equator receive more sunlight and therefore more heat. Slopes that face the poles receive less sunlight and therefore less heat.
