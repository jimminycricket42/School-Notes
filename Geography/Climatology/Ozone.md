# Ozone
There is a layer of gas that exists in the [[The Atmosphere|stratosphere]] that helps protect the earth from the suns radiation. We call this layer the ozone layer. There is good and bad ozone in [[the atmosphere]]. Good ozone keeps heat out of [[the atmosphere]], and bad ozone traps heat in the [[The Atmosphere|atmosphere]]. 

## Formation of Ozone
Ozone is a form of oxygen that is formed when UV rays strike an O<sub>2</sub> Molecule and breaks it into two O<sub>1</sub> molecules, which then combine with O<sub>2</sub> Molecules to create O<sub>3</sub> or ozone molecules. Ozone has a property that allows it to absorb [[Electromagnetic Spectrum|ultraviolet]] rays.

## Good and Bad Ozone
Good Ozone exists in the [[The Atmosphere|stratosphere]], as it absorbs incoming [[Heating of the Atmosphere|solar radiation]]. 
Bad Ozone exists in the [[The Atmosphere|Troposphere]], where it traps [[Heating of the Atmosphere|terrestrial radiation]] and acts as a pollutant that is harmful to the lungs, eyes, and to plants. 

## Ozone Depletion
Human activity has caused the *depletion of ozone in [[The Atmosphere|the stratosphere]]*. The use of aerosols, refrigerators, air conditioners, and industrial cleaning products releases *chlorofluorocarbons* (CFC's) that rise and collect in the [[The Atmosphere|stratosphere]]. There, the chlorine in CFC’s separate the O<sub>3</sub> and bond, forming CaO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub></sub>, causing the depletion of ozone. 

### Effects of UV radiation in the [[The Atmosphere|Troposphere]]
[[Electromagnetic Spectrum|Ultraviolet]] radiation affects people and plants in the following ways:
- Global Warming
	- Disrupts Photosynthesis, causing less crops and less O<sub>2</sub>
	- [Phytoplankton](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/phyto.html#:~:text=Phytoplankton%20are%20microscopic%20marine%20algae.&text=In%20a%20balanced%20ecosystem%2C%20they,order%20to%20live%20and%20grow.)  will decrease, causing a decrease in marine life
- Can cause health problems, such as:
	- Cataracts (blurry vision)
	- Faster aging of the skin
	- Skin [[Mitosis#Cancer – Uncontrolled Mitosis|cancer]]
	- weaker immune systems

### Reducing Ozone Depletion
When people realised CFC's deplete [[the atmosphere]] and cause negative side effects, they signed *the Montreal protocol*, which caused a massive decrease in the amount of human activities that involve CFC's. This was possible because scientists found suitable alternatives to CFC's that were ozone-friendly.
