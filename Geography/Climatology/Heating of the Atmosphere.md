# Heating of the Atmosphere
The Sun radiates *short-wave radiation* which travels through space to reach the Earth. Radiation from the sun then passes through [[the atmosphere]], heating the surface of the Earth. The earth then radiates *long-wave radiation* which heats [[the atmosphere]]. 
![[Radiation and the Atmosphere.svg]]

The sun's energy is called *radiant energy* or *insolation* (which is a word for incoming solar radiation)
The energy that is released from the Earth at night is called *terrestrial radiation*. 

## Heating of the Atmosphere by the Sun
We call the suns energy that passes through [[the atmosphere]] insolation. 
The sun emits both short-wave and long-wave radiation. Most of the [[Electromagnetic Spectrum|Ultraviolet]] Rays and [[Electromagnetic Spectrum|X-Rays]] are absorbed in the [[The Atmosphere|thermosphere]] and [[The Atmosphere|stratosphere]], causing the high temperatures in these layers. 
This also causes only 1 billionth of the suns energy to reach the [[The Atmosphere|Troposphere]], which we call the solar constant. 

### Reflection, scattering and absorption of insolation
Only 47% of the solar constant reaches the earth surface. This is due to reflection, scattering, and absorption of radiation by particles in [[the atmosphere]], such as [[Ozone]], Water Vapour, Dust particles, 

#### Reflection
When radiation hits a light surface, such as ice or sand, it is reflected back into [[the atmosphere]]. For instance, when insolation hits something lightly-coloured like sand or ice, it is reflected back into space. We refer to the reflectivity of a surface as *albedo*, with a high albedo being highly reflective. 

#### Scattering
When radiation strikes a dust particle in the [[The Atmosphere|troposphere]], it scatters in random directions, making it less likely to hit the surface.

#### Absorption
Gases in the [[The Atmosphere|troposphere]] absorb radiation and heat the [[The Atmosphere|troposphere]]. 

## Heating of the atmosphere by the Earth
The sun heats the earth's surface, and the Earth radiates it back into [[the atmosphere]] and creates what is known as *the heat balance*. 

we look at four different ways that [[the atmosphere]] is heated by the earth:
- Absorption of terrestrial radiation
- Conduction of the surface’s heat
- [[Convection Currents]]
- Release of latent heat during condensation ^latent-heat

![[Heating of the Atmosphere.excalidraw|100%]]

### Absorption of Terrestrial Radiation
The *long-wave terrestrial radiation* is released by the earth and absorbed by the [[The Atmosphere#Gases|gases of the atmosphere]], heating [[the atmosphere]]. Terrestrial radiation is mainly released at night, and includes energy absorbed by the ground and by water. 

The amount of these gases decrease as you go higher in the [[The Atmosphere|troposphere]], causing the temperature to drop as less energy is absorbed. 

### Conduction of the surface’s heat
Layers of air near the surface of the earth are warmer because the air absorbs the heat on the surface through conduction. However, air is a poor conductor, and this heat does not transfer higher in [[the atmosphere]] without [[Convection Currents]]. 

### Convection
Hot air in the lower layers of the [[The Atmosphere|troposphere]] expands and becomes less dense, allowing it to rise into the higher, colder layers of [[the atmosphere]] where it cools and sinks again. 

### Release of latent heat During Condensation
When something evaporates, heat is added. This heat is then stored until it can be released, and condensation occurs.  This occurs when water vapour condenses into clouds. 

## The Greenhouse Effect
Much like a greenhouse, [[the atmosphere]] traps heat. It allows short-wave insolation to enter the earth’s [[The Atmosphere|atmosphere]], but prevents long-wave terrestrial radiation from leaving the earth. This is done through *absorption* by *greenhouse gases*, such as:
- Water Vapor
- [[Ozone]]
- Carbon Dioxide

The greenhouse effect keeps the earth’s natural temperature around 15°c warmer than what would be without it. This prevents our nights from dropping below freezing, and makes our days warm enough for us to survive. Without the greenhouse effect plants, animals, and humans would all die. 

### Human Contribution to the Greenhouse Effect
Humans contribute more gases to the greenhouse effect through our daily lives. We enhance the greenhouse effect, causing global warming. 

Gases that contribute to global warming:
- Carbon dioxide – 50%
	- Source: Combustion of fossil fuels, Decay of plants and animals, forest fires. 
- Methane – 18%
	- Source: Livestock farming, Rice production
- CFC’s – 14%
	- Aerosols, refrigerants
- [[Ozone]] – 12%
	- Smog

Additionally, *deforestation* causes the amount of Carbon Dioxide in [[the atmosphere]] to increase, as trees absorb carbon dioxide while performing photosynthesis. 

### Impact of the Increase of the Greenhouse Effect 
If the greenhouse effect enlarges past a certain extent, it can have far-reaching negative impacts of the environment, as well as humans. These effects include:
- destruction of habitats
- Extinction of species (that cannot adapt to the higher temperatures)
- Melting of perma-ice causing rising sea-levels
- Changes in weather and climates
- Droughts, fires, and floods

there are also various health problems that can be caused by changes to the climate
- heatstroke caused by increasing temperatures
- Increase in infectious diseases caused by rising temperatures and increased rainfall
- Increase in water-borne diseases caused by floods and heavy-rain
- Malnutrition caused by a decrease in crop yields because of drought and rising temperatures. 


## Global Warming
There will be a predicted increase in the average temperature of the Earth of 1,4°C to 5,8°C in the next 100 years. This is because of [[#The Greenhouse Effect]] and the increase in of greenhouse gases (such as carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, CFC’s, and Methane). 

### Reasons for an increase of Greenhouse Gases in the Air
- Increasing *industrialisation* and the *burning of fossil fuels* increases the amount of Carbon monoxide and Nitrous Oxide in the air. 
- *Deforestation* decreases the Earth’s natural ability to process Carbon Dioxide
- Increasing the *amount of livestock farming* causes an increase in the amount of methane sent into the atmosphere.
	- Note: Methane can absorb a lot more heat than Carbon Dioxide with the same volume
- The amount of *decomposing organic matter* adds to the amount of methane in the atmosphere. 
	- Note: Methane can absorb a lot more heat than Carbon Dioxide with the same volume
- *Increased rice production* increases the amount of methane sent into the atmosphere by paddy fields
	- Note: Methane can absorb a lot more heat than Carbon Dioxide with the same volume
- *Waste Dumps* release Methane into the atmosphere
- *The use of aerosol sprays, refrigerants, and industrial cleaning agents* send CFC’s into the atmosphere

### Evidence of Global Warming
- The Earth is warmer than it was 100yrs ago (0.6°C – 0.7°C)
- Eleven of the twelve warmest years in recorded history have occurred since 1995
- As the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> increases, so does the temperature of the earth
- There is evidence for an increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in pure sea-air
- The icecaps are shrinking, and large pieces of ice are breaking off of the polar glaciers. 

### Consequences of Global Warming
- Areas will experience more, heavier rain, while other areas have more intense droughts
- Some animal and plant species may become extinct
- Destruction of tropical forests
- Changes in agriculture due to a change in water supply
- Melting of glaciers and ice-caps
- Increase in water-borne disease and heat-stress
- Rise in sea-levels
- Increase in uncontrollable forest fires
- Migration due to water shortages and flooding of coastal regions

### Solutions to deal with global warming
#### The Kyoto Protocol
The Kyoto protocol makes it a requirement for industrialised countries to reduce their emissions. This was done through a system of ‘emissions trading’, where there a company would require a permit to emit more carbon dioxide than their quota. 

#### Alternate Strategies
- Rewards and incentives for reducing their emissions
- Carbon Tax
- Storage of extracted Carbon Dioxide in the crust of the earth
- Environmentally friendly sources of energy
- Recycling
- Planting Trees
- Educating people about their social responsibility
