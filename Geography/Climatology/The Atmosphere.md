# The Atmosphere
The atmosphere is a thin layer of gas that surrounds the earth. We study it’s structure, its composition, and its purpose. It affects the [[Temperatures of different places in the world]], and has its own system of [[Heating of the Atmosphere]]. 

## Structure of the Atmosphere
The atmosphere is made up of four layers: the Thermosphere, the Mesosphere, the Stratosphere, and the Troposphere. We group these layers by the change of temperature that occurs in them — whether it increases with altitude or decreases with altitude. Between each layer you get a small zone, known as pauses

### The Thermosphere
The Thermosphere is the furthest layer from the earth's surface. It *absorbs* many of the *suns's harmful [[Electromagnetic Spectrum|X-rays]] and [[Electromagnetic Spectrum|Ultraviolet]] Rays*. This is why temperatures in this layer are *high* and *temperatures increase in altitude*. 

### The Mesosphere
The Mesosphere *prevents dust and rocks from entering the lower layers* of the atmosphere. Temperatures in this layer decrease with an increase in altitude. 

### The Stratosphere
The Stratosphere is the second layer above the earth's surface. It contains the gas *[[ozone]] (O<sub>3</sub>)* which *absorbs [[Electromagnetic Spectrum|ultraviolet]] rays*. This is why the *temperature in this layer increases with an increase in altitude*.

### The Troposphere
The Troposphere is the layer closest to the surface of the earth. It is approximately 17km thick and is the layer which contains most of the air in the atmosphere. It contains the gases which are essential for life on earth (Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Carbon Dioxide). It is the layer where all of our weather occurs. The temperature decreases as altitude increases. 

## Composition of the Atmosphere
The atmosphere is made up of many elements and molecules. All of these are essential for life on earth. 

### Liquids
The atmosphere contains water, both as water vapour and as clouds

### Solids
The solids in the atmosphere are not always visible to us, but the atmosphere contains millions of dust particles and salt crystals which act as [[Formation Of Clouds|condensation nuclei]]. 

### Gases
The amount of gases in the atmosphere changes as you move further from the earth's surface. In the [[The Atmosphere#The Troposphere}the troposphere]] there is a mixture of gases, some are in fixed amounts and other exist in changing amounts. 

#### Permanent Gases in the Troposphere
- Nitrogen — 78,08% — necessary for the growth of plants
- Oxygen — 20,94% — necessary for [[Respiration]]
- 0,93 — argon — byproduct of radioactive decay

#### Temporary gases in the troposphere
Carbon Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, Helium, [[Ozone]], Water vapour, methane, nitrous oxide, and sulphur dioxide

Some of these gases are called [[Heating of the Atmosphere|greenhouse gases]] because they absorb radiation which help heat the atmosphere. 

 ## The Importance of the Atmosphere
The atmosphere is essential for life on earth. It contains the gases: oxygen, carbon dioxide and water vapour which are  essential for life. The atmosphere also protects us from harmful rays from the sun. It also regulates the temperature of the earth by keeping heat out in the day and trapping heat in at night. Furthermore, the atmosphere is necessary for weather because it allows gases to heat up and move. 

-  The atmosphere contains gases that are necessary for life to exist, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapour.
- The atmosphere protects us from harmful rays from the sun, such as [[Electromagnetic Spectrum|X-rays]] and UV-rays. These rays are absorbed in [[#The Thermosphere]] and [[#The Stratosphere]].
- The atmosphere regulates the temperature of the earth by absorbing and reflecting heat in the day, and trapping heat at night. 
- The atmosphere gives a medium for weather to occur, creating conditions that are necessary for life.
