# Clouds
## Look
All clouds are white, but thicker clouds appear grey because less sunlight gets through. The height and width of the clouds depends on temperature of the atmosphere and vertical air currents. 

## Formation
Clouds form when water condenses in the atmosphere. Condensation requires a surface to occur, or a *condensation nucleus*, which in the case of the atmosphere is *salt and dust crystals in the air*. 

The atmosphere must cool to [[Moisture in the Atmosphere|dew point]] for condensation to occur, meaning that it is only when the air is at a certain temperature will clouds form. This is affected by the [[Temperatures of different places in the world#Altitude|Altitude]] of the air, and as we know, air cools by around 1°C for every 100m of altitude. This is known as the *dry adiabatic lapse rate*. 

[[Moisture in the Atmosphere#^17ef05|The Condensation Layer]] is the layer at which condensation occurs. If the [[Moisture in the Atmosphere|relative humidity]] is high, the clouds will be lower, as the air does not need to cool as much before condensation can occur. if the [[Moisture in the Atmosphere|relative humidity]] is low, the clouds will be much higher, as the air has to cool a lot before condensation can occur. 

If a cloud forms high enough, *ice crystals* are formed instead of water droplets. 

## Naming of Clouds
### Height
Medium altitude – alto-
High altitude – cirro-

### types
High, wispy – cirrus
Layered – stratus
‘cotton wool’ – Cumulus
Bringing rain – Nimbus

these can be combined to get things like cumulonimbus, or nimbostratus
