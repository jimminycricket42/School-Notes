# Topographic Maps
#gr10/Q1 #mapwork/types-of-maps 

Topographic maps are detailed maps with illustrations to represent man-made and natural features. Topographic maps are the standard for orienteering and navigation. The entire world has been mapped, and has a topographic map showing that area. For this the *topographic map index* was made, where every topographic map shows 1/16th of a ° (15'x15').

## Scale
Topographic maps are always at a 1:50000 [[Scale]], where 1 cm on the map represents 50000 cm on the ground, with a contour interval of 20m. For more information, see [[Scale]] and [[Maps#Contour Lines]]

>[!Exam Question] Exam Question 
> Q: Convert 7,4cm on the map to metres on the ground with a scale of 1:50000
> A: $$ \textrm{Distance on the ground} = 7.4cm \times \frac{ \textrm{50000} }{ \textrm{100} } = 3700m$$

> What are the 6 colours found on a Topographic map and their meanings?

## Name
All maps have a name that vaguely describes the area they depict. On Topographic maps, the full name consists of the area name, as well as the Grid Reference

`` 3319BC De Doorns ``

### Map Index
At the top of a Topographic map is a map index that tells you:
1. The longitude and latitude (3319)
2. A grid reference (BC)
3. A name (De Doorns)

### Grid Reference
Each degree square is separated into four quarters, labelled A, B, C and D. Each quarter is 30' wide and 30' long. Each one of these quarters is broken into another 4 quarters, also labelled A, B, C, and D. Each minor quadrant is 15' wide and 15' long. Each minor quadrant makes up one Topographic map. 
To make a grid reference, you put the Major quadrant next to the Minor quadrant, making: "AA, AB, AC, AD, BA, ..."
