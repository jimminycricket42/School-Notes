# Scale
#gr10/Q1 #mapwork/parts-of-a-map

All [[Maps]] are proportionally reduced representations of an area. The scale determines the amount of reduction, and is stated on the map somewhere. Because of this, we can calculate the distance in real life off of a distance we measure on a map. 

## Types of Scales
There are three types of scales we use:
- a Word scale
- a Line scale
- a Ratio scale

### Word Scales
`` One centimetre on the map is equivalent to 25000 centimetres on the map ``
### Line Scales

### Ratio/Fraction Scales
`` 1:25000 ``
or
$$\frac{1}{50000}$$

## Calculating Distances
#mapwork/practical-skills 

There are two formulas for Calculating distance from the map or distance from the ground:
1. Map to Ground — Small to Big equals Scale over Conversion factor
	$$ \textrm{Distance on the ground} = \textrm{Distance on the map} \times \frac{ \textrm{Scale Factor} }{ \textrm{Conversion Factor} }$$
2. Ground to map — Big to Small equals Conversion factor over Scale
	$$ \textrm{Distance on the map} = \textrm{Distance on the ground} \times \frac{ \textrm{Conversion Factor} }{ \textrm{Scale Factor} }$$
>[!Exam Question] Exam Questions  
>Q: Convert 8.5cm on the map to kilometres on the ground with a scale of 1:25000
>A: $$ \textrm{Distance on the ground} = {8.5} \times \frac{ {100000} }{ \textrm{25000} }$$
## Calculating Area
The formula for calculating area is:
$$\textrm{Area} = Length \times Breadth \times Scale^2 $$
Remember to convert all numbers to the same unit of measure. 
If the area you are measuring isn't square, break it up into squares on your map, work out the area of a square, and then count the amount of squares.   

### Conversion factors

|         km |      m |       cm |        mm |
| ----------:| ------:| --------:| ---------:|
|        1km |  1000m | 100000cm | 1000000mm |
|    0,001km |     1m |    100cm |   1 000mm |
|  0,00001km |  0,01m |      1cm |      10mm |
| 0,000001km | 0,001m |    0,1cm |       1mm |
