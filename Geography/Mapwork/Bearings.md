# Bearings
When talking about direction in geography, we refer to *bearings*. There are three types of bearings we deal with, *True bearings, Grid bearings, and Magnetic bearings*.

Bearings are measured in degrees going clockwise from their origin. There are 16 common directions that we label — 4 main directions (Representing Hemispheres), and 12 sub-directions. We measure bearings using a compass.

## True North
True north exists at the poles — where the earth turns on it's axis — and where the gridlines on [[Maps]] point to. 

## Grid North
Grid north is the lines of latitude that run over the earth between the poles. It is almost synonymous with true north, however because the earth is not flat, we cannot use true north on [[Maps]]. We have to distort the [[Maps]] to make them appear square, and so, grid north was created. 

## Magnetic North
Magnetic north exists where the electromagnetic field of the earth penetrates the earth's crust. True north and Magnetic north are not at the same point. In South Africa, the difference is about 24° west. We call this difference *magnetic declination*, and there an indication of magnetic declination on all [[Topographic Maps]]. 

To work out magnetic bearing, we use the following formula:

$$ \textrm{Magnetic Bearing} = \textrm{True Bearing} + \textrm{Magnetic Declination}$$

Magnetic bearing changes over time, and the rate of change is normally shown at the bottom of [[Topographic Maps]]. For example:

> The magnetic declination is 23°16' West of True North for 2001. The mean annual change is 3' westwards. 


The formula for this would be:
$$ \textrm{New Magnetic Declination} = \textrm{Old Magnetic Declination} + (\textrm{Mean Annual Change} \times \textrm{Years Passed})$$

### Example
Q: The magnetic declination is 23°16' West of True North for 2001. The mean annual change is 3' westwards

$$
\textrm{New Magnetic Declination} = 23°16' + (3' \times (2022-2001)) = 24°19' 
$$
