# Cross Sections


Cross sections show the profile of a landscape, and allow us to better understand how the height of the land changes. They are like more detailed [[gradients]], in that they show how the land raises or falls. 

## How to make a Cross section

This video explains how to make a Cross Section

### Steps
1. find two points
2. measure the distance between points and draw that onto your graph paper
3. with a piece of paper, place the straight edge of the paper between the two points on the map. Mark off the start and the end point with the height they sit at. 
4. Read the contour lines between the two points and mark their position and their  heights on your paper. 
5. Look at the heights that you marked and decide on a suitable vertical scale to fill your graph. This does not need to start at 0. 
6. Mark off your height interval on your graph paper at equal intervals
7. Put your piece of paper against your graph paper and align the start and end locations
8. Move your piece of paper up or down your graph to mark the heights
9. Join the dots
10. Add headings for the axes and the graph itself

#### Vertical Exaggeration
Because you use different vertical and horizontal scales, your cross section will have a *vertical exaggeration*. This means that your vertical axis is distorted compared to your horizontal axis. We use a simple formula to work our vertical exaggeration:
$$\textrm{Vertical Exaggeration} = \frac{\textrm{Vertical Scale}}{\textrm{Horizontal Scale}}$$
Cross sections can be a good way to determine [[intervisibility]]
