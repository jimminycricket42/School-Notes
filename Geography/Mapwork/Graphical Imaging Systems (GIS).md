# Graphical Imaging Systems (GIS)

GIS is an information system used to capture and manipulate data to create [[maps]] that provide insights on the areas they depict. GIS links information to create new information, for example, linking the areas that a disease affects with the population, allowing us to see high-risk areas. GIS uses *remote sensing* to collect and transmit data

## Reasons for the Creation Of GIS
GIS was created because:
- Our world has
	- A lot of people
	- Large Cities that need better planning
	- People who need to travel far every day
	- Large amounts of resources that need [[transport]]
	- Complicated politics
All of these have a geo-spatial component, meaning they take place in earth's space. GIS can bring all of this information together and create better understanding. 

GIS allows us to quickly answer big questions, such as:
- Is this an accessible and profitable place for a strip mall?
- Which schools are good to use as voting stations 
- Which learners in a school need a bus service
- How is global warming affecting sea-levels
- Where are weeds the biggest problem
- Where are the best places to sink boreholes and route pipelines
- Will there be enough places in schools for learners in this area?
- In which parts of South Africa is the ground suitable for the growth of crops

Additionally, GIS is a useful research tool in biology, geology, environmental science, sociology, politics, economics, town planning, and business. 

## Remote Sensing
Remote sensing tis the gathering of data and information about the earth. Aeroplanes and satellites orbiting the earth collect data and send it through satellites and relay it to ground stations where it is processed and stored. 
There are two types of sensing systems we use, active and passive sensing. 

### Passive sensing
Passive sensing systems have sensors that measure energy signals radiating from earth. They provide information such as temperature, soil type, land use and the presence of ships and aeroplanes. They can gather new information on the earth regularly. 

### Active Sensing
Active Sensing systems send out radiation towards the earth and measure the information that the earth sends back . They provide information such as minerals and rock types, sea temperatures, ocean currents, land use, crops, and even crop diseases. Because they use microwave radiation, they can obtain measurements at any time, and can penetrate clouds, smoke, and dust.
