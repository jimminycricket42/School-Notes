# Orthophoto Maps
#gr10/Q1 #mapwork/types-of-maps

The effects of tilt and relief are removed from an [[Photograph Maps|aerial photograph]] to create an orthophoto. Because Orthophotos are images, they do not require symbols, but an orthophoto may serve as a base map onto which other map information may be overlaid. Orthophoto Maps often have [[Maps#Contour Lines|contour lines]].

### Scale
Orthophoto maps are always at a 1:10000 [[Scale]], where 1cm on the map represents 10000cm on the ground, with a contour interval of 5m. for more information see [[Scale]] and [[Maps#Contour Lines]]
