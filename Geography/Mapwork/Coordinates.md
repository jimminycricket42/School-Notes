# Coordinates
Coordinates are a way to describe where we are on earth. This is done through the lines that appear on maps, globes, and charts. We split the world's axes into 360°, which we call longitude and latitude, which define how far north or south we are, or how far east or west we are. 

When writing out coordinates, we always say the [[Bearings|North/South]] coordinate than the [[Bearings|East/West]] coordinate. Your typical coordinate looks like: 36° 14' 15" S, 19° 12' 13" E. 

## Lines of Longitude
The lines of longitude run from north to south, with the starting point (0°) being called the prime meridian, or the Greenwich meridian (either is accepted). These lines *separate the world into the east and west hemispheres*. They are known as meridians. The world is split into 360° by meridians, 180 east of the prime meridian and 180 west.

There are two special lines of longitude: The Greenwich Meridian and the International Date line. 

Often we find lines of longitude of [[Maps]] and [[The Globe|Globes]] that have been overlaid by a [[Graphical Imaging Systems (GIS)]]

## Lines of latitude
The lines of latitude run from east to west, and the starting point (0°) being called the equator. The lines of latitude *separate the world into north and south hemispheres*. They are known as parallel arcs. There are 180° degrees of latitude, 90 north and 90 south. The north and south poles occur at 90°.

There are three special lines of latitude: The Equator, the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5°S) and the Tropic of Cancer (23.5°N). 

Often we find lines of Latitude of [[Maps]] and [[The Globe|Globes]] that have been overlaid by a [[Graphical Imaging Systems (GIS)]]
 
## Degrees, minutes, and seconds
To make latitude and longitude more precise, we split those blocks into 60 pieces, which we call minutes and we denote with '. We further split minutes into 60 sections, which we call seconds and we denote with ".
