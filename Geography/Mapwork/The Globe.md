## Hemispheres
The world has four hemispheres, north, south, east and west. The north is divided from the south by the equator. The east is separated by the prime/Greenwich meridian.

## The axis and rotation
The axis of the earth is an imaginary line that passes between the south and north pole through the centre of the planet. The earth spins on its axis, and this is called the rotation of the earth, and is not to be confused with the revolution. The earth rotates from west to east, and this causes day and night, and the time zones. With times zones, it centres around the greenwich/prime meridian, located at longitude: 0. If you move east from there you 'gain' and if you go west you 'lose' time.

### Revolution
Revolution is the way that the earth moves through space around the sun. The earths axis is off by about 23.5 degrees from the perpendicular. This creates the seasons, as the sun has unequal amounts of sun on different points at different times of year.

## Equinox, solstice, and the midday sun
### Equinox
 the two days a year when the day and the night are the exact same length/ this happens on the 21 march and the 23 September. These are often affiliated with summer and autumn

### Solstice
 these two days are the longest and shortest of the year. The solstices occur on the 21 December and the 21 June. The longest day is in summer and the shortest in winter.
 
### The Midday Sun
The north pole has a phenomena called the midday sun due to the tilt of the earth. They have sunshine for 6 months of the years, and darkness for 6 months.
