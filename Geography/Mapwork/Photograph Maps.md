# Photographs
#gr10/Q1 #mapwork/types-of-maps 

Photographs are a way of showing detailed information about a place without the use of symbols or markers. There are three kinds of photos geographers use to further their understanding of landscapes and places:
- Horizontal Photographs
- Vertical Aerial Photographs
- Oblique Photographs

## Horizontal Photographs
Horizontal Photographs are ground-level views, which show objects close to the camera as larger than objects further away, and also hides smaller objects behind larger objects. This makes it difficult to find sizes and distances of objects, but it is very recognizable.

## Vertical Aerial Photographs
Vertical Aerial Photographs are birds-eye views which show all objects from above. This allows us to see everything, however the photograph becomes distorted around the edges, making it unfit for navigation. However, it is hard to recognize things from a birds-eye view.

We use vertical aerial photographs to make [[Orthophoto Maps]]

## Oblique Photographs
Oblique photographs are taken from an angle that is not parallel or perpendicular to the ground, which gives us a easy-to-recognize image that shows a large area but cannot be used for measuring distances or navigation.
