# Inter-visibility
Inter-visibility determines whether places have a direct line of sight between each other. 
- Two points of the same height are inter-visible if there is no higher terrain between them.
- Where [[Maps#Contour Lines|contours]] show a convex slope, the summit is not visible from the foot of the hill.
- Where [[Maps#Contour Lines|contours]] show a concave slope, the summit and the foot of the hill are inter visible.
