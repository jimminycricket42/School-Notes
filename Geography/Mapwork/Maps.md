# Maps
#gr10/Q1  #mapwork/types-of-maps 

A map is a *two-dimensional* representation of a *three dimensional plane* with *symbols* superimposed to better convey data about the area they are representing. These maps are *proportionally reduced* using a [[Scale]]. 

## Types of maps
We look at the following types of maps:
- [[Topographic Maps]]
- [[Orthophoto Maps]]
- Aerial and oblique photo maps

## Parts of maps
Maps have to provide information about the area they describe, and they have to do this graphically. To do this multiple methods are used, such as:
- Signs and Symbols 
	- Key
	- Contour Lines
	- Colours
	- Trigonometric beacons, Benchmarks, and Spot Heights
- [[Scale]]
- [[Coordinates]]
- Map Names
- North Indicator

### Signs and symbols
Maps use signs and symbols to define certain features on them. There are a lot of different symbols, but they fall into three categories:
1. Point symbols — such as schools, graves, and some buildings
2. Lines symbols — such as roads, provincial borders, or rivers
3. Area symbols — such as woodlands, orchards, or lakes
These symbols are defined by a [[Topographic Map Key.png|key]], and are known as *conventional signs*. 

There are a few areas of note when talking about symbols, such as they key , contour lines and colours. 

#### Key

> Know how to identify conventional symbols, as well as how to draw them. 

#### Contour Lines
Contour lines are a method of representing height on a map using brown, continuous lines that join all places at a certain height above sea level. The height difference between contour lines is called the *contour interval*, and it changes depending on different map types.

##### Features of Contours
- Contours never cross
- Contours that are far apart indicate a gentle slope
- Contour that are close together indicate a steep slope
- Contours that are close together indicate a constant slope

We can use contour lines to draw and work out [[Gradients]].  

#### Colours
In general, you will see the following colours on Maps:
-  <span style="color:brown">Brown</span> — contour lines and land features
-  <span style="color:blue">Blue</span> — water features
-  <span style="color:green">Green</span> — vegetation
-  <span style="color:black">Black</span> — Constructed Features
-  <span style="color:red">Red</span> — constructed features and main roads

#### Trigonometric beacons, Benchmarks, and Spot Heights
##### Spot Heights
Spot heights indicate the exact height in metres above sea level of a specific point, normally the peak of a hill or a spur, or the lowest point in a valley.

##### Trigonometric beacons
Also known as trig beacons, these indicate the exact height in metres above sea level of a specific point. These are found at the summit of large mountains
![[Trig Beacon.png]]
The bottom number is the Trig Beacon number, and the top number is the height above sea level
##### Benchmarks
Benchmarks indicate the exact height in metres above sea level of a specific point, normally along the course of a road or a path.

### Scale
Maps are proportionally reduced by a [[Scale]], meaning that you can accurately work out distance and size of objects on the map by converting *the distance on the map* to *the distance on the ground* using the formula:
$$ \textrm{Distance on the ground} = \textrm{Distance on the map} \times \frac{ \textrm{Scale Factor} }{\textrm{Conversion Factor} } $$
There are multiple types of scales, most maps will include a *Ratio Scale*, a *Word Scale*, and a *Line Scale*. 

For more information, see [[Scale]]. 

### Coordinates
The world is split into a grid, marked by the lines of longitude and latitude. These are indicated as Degrees (°), Minutes ('), and Seconds ("). There are 60' in a °, and 60" in a '. This can allow you to give your position on a map accurate to 20m. 

### Map Names
All maps have a name that vaguely describes the area they depict.

### North Indicator
At the bottom of most maps is an arrow that shows True north and Magnetic north. The map will often also state the magnetic deviation in °, as well as the mean magnetic declination
