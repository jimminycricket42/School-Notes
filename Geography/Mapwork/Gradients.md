# Gradient
Gradient is the steepness of the slope, and it can tell you about the angle of the slope. Slopes can be defines as steep or gentle, depending on the vertical and horizontal distance they cover. 

## Calculating Gradient
```desmos-graph
left = 0; right = 100;
bottom = 0; top = 100;
---
y=0.45x
```
the formula to graph gradient is:
$$Gradient = \frac{\textrm{Vertical distance}}{\textrm{Horizontal Distance}}$$
Gradient is always displayed as a graph or a ratio.
