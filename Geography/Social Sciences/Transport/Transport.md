## Types of transport

- Machines
- Electrical goods.
There are also oil tankers that transport goods
They only transport oil

### Road
Most forms of transport have some distance travelled by road. There are many types of land vehicles, such as cars, motorbikes, bakkies, and specialised vehicles. They are mostly used for short-distances within the same country and city

They transport:
- Pizza
- Tools
- Furniture
- Etc.

### Air

They will transport items such as:
- People
- Diamonds

- Flowers
- Things that need to stay fresh.

### Rails

They transport things like:
- gold
- coal
- Iron
- steel

### Pipeline
Pipelines transport large amounts of oil over land.

They mostly transport oil but can also transport water

## Transport networks
Transport networks are systems set up within countries that allow for the rapid transport across multiple types of transport. They include multiple types of transport, such as busses, cars/taxi's, trains, bikes, boats, and other forms of transport.
The exact definition is: transport used by the general public to get from one place to another. Ie. buses, trains, taxi's, etc.
They are usually owned by governments that are either local or provincial. They are often funded by taxes, with a small amount of profit from actual tickets.

## Public transport
### Trains / metro / subways / rapid transport systems
These are ways of transporting large amount of people very quickly between large spaces. They are often separated from regular transport systems by being belowground, above ground, or in dedicated lanes and special tracks. Examples of this are the Gautrain in Johannesburg or the underground in Britain.

### Bus Lanes
In some cities certain lanes of roads become bus lanes. This happens often in cities that experience 'rush hour' because it allows for the release of congestion on the roads through using buses opposed to cars.

### Bicycles in cities
Some cities are placing bike sharing schemes around cities. This means that they place terminals around cities filled with special bikes provided by the government.
You go online and buy a membership 'key' that unlocks the bikes at the stations. After unlocking the bike, a timer starts that determines how much you pay for your ride. The first 30 minutes are free.
There are special bicycle lanes to allow for safe, car free journeys.

### Restricted car use zones (+car free zones)
Some places only allow travellers to commute in cars with certain characteristics during certain hours in order to increase the usage of public transport and reduce congestion.
Other areas do not allow cars to enter, which creates safe zones for people to be on the streets.
Only people, bikes, and some forms of public transport are allowed in these zones.

### Subsidised public transport
Many governments help support public transport through taxes. This is known as subsidisation. This allows transport fees for commuters to remain low

### Park and ride
The idea behind this is that when you commute into an are of town, you park your car and then use public transport. This reduces congestion and pollution while still keeping travel convenient. You park your car in large carparks outside of a city area, and then you use public transport into town.
