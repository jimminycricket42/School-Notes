# Components of development
#GR9 #social-sciences/development 

- Economic development - wealth and money
- Social development - living conditions
- Environmental development - land and resources

## What lets us compare different [[development levels]]?
We use Development indicators to provide us information about things such as wealth, health, and education
Each development indicators focuses on a specific aspect of development. There are:
- Economic indicators
- Social indicators
- Environmental indicators

### Economic Indicators
These tell us about wealth and income. We commonly use GDP (Gross Domestic Products). We measure the GDP per Capita, which is how much money every person in a country would have if all the money earned in one year was divided equally among the population. This is given in US dollars, as comparing every country to a single currency allows for better and more fair comparison.

$$\textrm{GDP per capita} = \frac{\textrm{GDP}}{\textrm{Total Population}}$$

#### For example:
- How much money is spent on luxury goods
- The numbers of computers in a society
- The amount of power draw a society has

### Social indicators
Social indicators have to do with people. We look at conditions within the society that have to affect peoples quality of being/quality of life.
Life expectance plays a role, poorer countries normally have a lower life expectancy. Infant mortality also plays a role. Some are born too small to survive and some die from diseases.

Things that play a role are:
- Health
- Education
- Literacy
- Housing

### Environmental indicators
We look at the impact of human activity on the environment and our natural resources. The environment people with resources needed to create wealth and live a comfortable life. However, the world's population is increasing and therefore more resources are used, more waste is generated, and there is more damage to the environment.

Environmental indicators measure the extent and the affects of human impact on the environment, such as:
- Percentage of polluting gas in [[the atmosphere]]
- Quantity of non-renewable resources used
- Drop in fish stocks
- Water quality

### Cost to the environment
Some countries have high GDP per capita and high social development scores, but normally they use a lot of resources and cause lots of damage to the environment. These countries have achieved high development scores at the expense of the environment. For development to continue into the future, a balance between economic, social, and environmental goals is needed.

## Human development Index (HDI)
The human development index was created to include the social aspect as well as the economic aspect of development. It does not include any environmental development indicators. It is calculated every year and countries are ranked on their HDI. 

HDI includes indicators from different sectors:
- GDP per capita (economic)
- Education (social)
- Life expectancy (social)
