# Factors affecting global Development
#GR9 #social-sciences/development 

World development is affected by the [[Components of Development]]. We use the following to compare [[Development Levels]]:
-   Trade
-   Historical reasons
-   Political stability
-   Education
-   Health and welfare
-   Technology and industrialiasation

## Trade
Globalisation is an extension of the unequal trading relationship that began under colonosiation. Multinational companies began using raw, local materials and cheap labour to produce goods in the LEDC’s cheaply,and then they sell the product at a higher profit margin in MEDC’s.

International trade helps circulate goods around the world. This has increased rapidly since the 1970’s. This trade is normally driven by large, multinational companies. People in rich countries gain money from poorer countries resources by selling them at a profit.

## Historical reasons
To put it simply, the past influences the present. Colonisation occurred between 1500-1900 and created eneven wealth between “host” and “colonising” countries. European countries conquered and ruled large areas of land across most of the world. The aim was to control as many resources as possible.
Colonies were a source of cheap labour for raw materials, which were exported to rich countries and processed before being resold to the colony for high prices.
This feeds into modern day globalisation through the exploitation of underdeveloped countries, who are underdeveloped because colonies focused on raw material output and crippled their future capabilities. Newly independent countries had trouble moving away from the structures set into place by the colonizers.

## Technology and industrialisation
LEDC’s first contact with manufacturing occurred under colonisation. The technologically advanced countries colonised countries with abundant raw resources. The colonies never gained access to the level of technology of the colonizers, leading to colonies struggling with the usage of modern technology and never developing past that point.

## Health and welfare
Health deals with the physical issues, such as illness
Welfare deals with the mental well being of a person, and is influenced by things like security and stability
In general, higher developed societies have better health and welfare.
Opportunities for development are limited when societies have issues with health and welfare. They often occur more in lower developed areas, as poor nutrition and housing, as well as poor work conditions, affect health.

### Raising health and welfare levels:
- Health and welfare - Municipal services
- Health and Welfare - Housing  
- Health - Healthcare
- Health - Nutrition
- Welfare - Job opportunities
- Welfare - Education and skills training
- Welfare - Roads and [[transport]]
- Welfare - Security and peace of mind

## Education
Education support development. Poor education affects the work force. Less skills and knowledge lead to the inability to improve quality of life. Education itself starts a cycle of improvement:

1. Reduces poverty
2. Makes society more equal
3. Increases wealth
4. Creates a stable society
5. Produces skilled workers
6. Helps people fight disease
7. Spreads knowledge

## Political stability
Places experiencing conflict, war, political disturbances or social unrest are defined as politically unstable. Political stability is necessary to maintain efficient and smooth operation of a country. Countries in war are considered the most politically unstable.
