# Play Summary: The Merchant of Venice
<u>The Merchant of Venice</u> is a play about Antonio, a christian in Venice, who helps his friend Bassanio to woo Portia of Belmont. To do this, the two take a loan from shylock, a usurer in Venice. As collateral, Antonio puts down a pound of flesh if he cannot repay the loans when his ships arrive carrying his fortunes. This allows Bassanio to marry Portia, but Antonio’s ships sink, and Bassanio must save him. In the end, Portia’s wit allows her to disguise as a lawyer and save Antonio from death. ^blurb

## A1
Act one serves as the [[Stages of a Plot#Exposition|Exposition]] of <u>The Merchant of Venice</u>. In Act 1 we are introduced to many characters. This includes [[Salarino]], [[Solanio]], [[Antonio]], [[Bassanio]], [[Lorenzo]], And [[Gratiano]]. We also see the main setting for the play: Venice, as well as the home of [[Portia]] and [[Nerissa]]: Belmont

### A1S1
We immediately see a property of Antonio – his utter despair for life. He is miserable at the beginning of the play, and remains miserable at the end. The only time he is joyful is when he is with Bassanio. This not only shows us [[The Brotherhood Between Antonio and Bassanio]], but also suggests that there might be something more between them. 

> There are suggestion of two themes here: The depth of love; and the misery of the successful

As is typical in Shakespeare, the conflict of the play is revealed in the first scene. In the very first scene, Salarino wishes that his ships are safe on their voyages, and later Antonio's ships run aground and are damaged. This is evidence of [[Prolepsis]]. 

In scene 1 we are introduced to [[Gratiano]], who serves as comedic relief, and attempts to play the fool to change Antonio’s mood. This does not work, but Antonio’s mood raises after Gratiano leaves and Antonio is left with Bassanio, where we are introduced to the main plot of the story – Bassanio’s need for money to marry Portia. 

### A1S2
In A1S2 we are transported to Belmont, where we are introduced to Portia and Nerissa, and their struggles. However, it is shown in the story that there are fewer struggles for the two than there is good. 

Portia’s main struggle is the will of her dead father who set a challenge to choose a worthy suitor for her. She can neither choose who she wants, nor reject those she does not want. She speaks of each of them to her serving-maid, Nerissa, and tells her why each suitor is a bad match for her until a serving-man tells her that the suitors have arrived. A surprise suitor arrives, and we see the racist feelings of the time. Portia says that if the suitor is black she would rather absolve than marry him. 

### A1S3
In A1S3 we are introduced to our main villain – [[Shylock]], who loans money to Antonio. Shylock reveals his hate for Christianity
