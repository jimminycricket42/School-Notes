# Themes of The Merchant of Venice
- “A Pound of flesh”
	- Getting what is due to you, no matter how high the cost
- Money is all important, and the Misery of the successful
	- Those with money in The Merchant Of Venice are often miserable, angry, or are betrayed for their money. Antonio is not happy as a merchant, as he is always melancholy. Shylock is angry and vengeful for money. Portia was married for her money by Bassanio, and even then they weren’t entirely happy together. 
- Brotherhood (as in the [[The Brotherhood Between Antonio and Bassanio]])
- The Depth of love – Shylock’s lack of love for Jessica, Antonio’s unquestioning love for Bassanio, Bassanio’s money-driven love for Portia, etc. 
- The will of a father on a daughter – Portia’s father and the caskets, Shylock’s focus on money over his daughter
-
