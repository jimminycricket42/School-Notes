# The Brotherhood between Antonio and Bassanio
Within *The Merchant of Venice*, Antonio and Bassanio have a close friendship, almost a brotherhood. Through their brief interactions, the audience gets a feeling that the two have a history of favours, trust, and friendship. Antonio supports Bassanio, and Bassanio uses his support liberally, leading the audience to ask the question: How friendly is their friendship?

When Bassanio asks for a loan, he cites the reason that his lavish lifestyle has left him penniless, and that he wishes to borrow from Antonio. Antonio Agrees to this, and this shows two things: Bassanio is lavish, and lives life fully without regards for the affects on himself or others, as is made apparent by him “disabling his estate”. Antonio is generous, and is happy to support Bassanio’s whims. This is further bolstered by Shylock saying that Antonio “lends out money gratis”. This also shows Antonio’s support of Bassanio. 

Antonio trusts in Bassanio’s plan to acquire wealth, despite him using the childish logic of “When I had lost one shaft, I shot his fellow of the selfsame flight… I oft found both.” Despite this, Antonio still lends him 3000 Ducats, showing us that Bassanio childishly uses Antonio’s gratitude. The only time we see Bassanio caring for Antonio is when Shylock threatens to take a pound of flesh, and while Antonio is fearless, Bassanio hesitates and worries for his friend. Nonetheless, things seem to go in Bassanio’s favour, almost as if he has the “Grace of God”, as said by Lancelot Gobbo in Act 2 Scene 2. 

Antonio repeatedly speaks of his extreme fondness for Bassanio, and his reckless, childish behaviour. Despite knowing that Bassanio has not repaid past debts to him, he still agrees to Bassanio “[winding] about [his] love with circumstance;” Bassanio takes from Antonio without giving back, and shows that he is unreliable, and that the friendship of Bassanio and Antonio is one-sided and that Bassanio is a bad friend. 

Despite their pasts, their close friendship, and the unending support Antonio gives for Bassanio, their friendship is one sided and is made of false depth. There is no good reason for Antonio to be friends with Bassanio, other than their history, and overall Bassanio simply uses Antonio for his money, and for his affection.
