Creative Writing consists of many forms of text. It is the epitome of the English language as it combines many disciplines, such as [[Direct and Indirect Speech]], [[Textual Editing]], [[Dramatic Analysis]], etc. ^blurb

## Parts of the Writing Process
1. Before writing – what should you know?
2. Planning – planning is key to writing a good essay
	1. Plot – what is gonna happen in your story and when?
3. Writing – what to include? what should you know?
	1. How to begin, develop, and end

### Before Writing
Check your topics – what do you know the most about, which one is the easiest to argue/write on? Is there one that screams out for you?

Once you choose your topic, brainstorm what you’re going to write about. Write down your general direction, what you want to talk about, and how you’re going to link that to the question. 

Make sure you understand the format of the piece you are writing – it’s no use to make a bombin’ email for an essay piece. See [[#Types of Writing]] below. 

### Planning your essay
Plans can happen in many ways. For instance – you can make a mind map, a flowchart, bullet points, or a sketch. Try and keep it brief to ensure you have enough time to actually write. Whatever you decide, make sure to keep it ordered so that you understand the link and flow from one part to the next. 

From there you can write a draft if you have the time, but if your planning is good you likely won’t need one. 

Don’t forget to look at your plot
