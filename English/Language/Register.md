### Jargon

### Slang
There are 4 types of slang:
-   Words that mean something other than what they are supposed to. Eg. Dough = Money
-   A foreign word not adopted into formal english. Eg. Vamoose, meaning go in mexican
-   Cockney rhyming slang. Eg. “Plates of meat” = feet
-   A new word made of combining two existing words. Eg. “Awesome” being a combination of “awe” and “some”

### Colloquial language
Colloquial language is relaxed, informal language. It can be area specific, and include careless uses of grammar.

### Journalese, officialese, and commercialese
These terms refer to the long-winded, wordy, ornate, and often incomprehensible style of writing often used by writers in the press, government officials, and by many writers of letters and documents. This is poor style, and should he avoided.
