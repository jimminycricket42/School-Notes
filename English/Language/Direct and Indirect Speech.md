# Direct and Indirect Speech
Direct speech is the words of a speaker, while indirect speech is how others understood and convey the words of a speaker. Indirect speech is like 2nd person view, while direct speech is 1st person. ^blurb
 
## Direct speech
Direct speech uses the exact words of the speaker and is indicated by inverted commas ("…") A new paragraph is used to distinguish between each speaker. In a cartoon or comic, these words are contained within speech bubbles.

### Direct speech consists of two parts:
1. A clause containing the introductory verb such as said or asked
    - This indicates the speaker.
    - The introductory verb is always followed by a comma.
2. The actual words that are spoken
    - These are enclosed in quotation marks/inverted commas.
    - The first word begins with a capital letter.

## Indirect/Reported Speech
Reported speech is telling information in the second person – talking about someone else’s actions, using the appropriate verbs and pronouns. 

To change a sentence into reported speech, we must use a *reporting verb*: **says** or **tell** (remember to put them in the appropriate tense)

We must also change some pronouns to refer to the person who we are reporting on:

| Direct Speech | Reported Speech |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| I             | He/she/they     |
| You           | I               |

> [!example]+ 💡 Example
> 
> “Move Aside” → He told me to move aside
> 
> “I can’t finish this meal” → He could not finish his meal

The tense will change, either being simple or continuous, depending on if the information being reported on is still true. 
> [!example]+ 💡 Tense Changes
> 
> **Present Continuous** “You should go cycling” → He told me that I should go cycling 
> **Simple Past** “I bought a car” → She said she had bought a car

### Reported Questions
The same logic applies to questions, where we change the verbs and pronouns to create a reported question. In this case, our *reporting verb* is **asked**

> [!example]+ 💡 Reported Question
> 
> Where do you live? → She asked me where I live?

### Reported Orders and Requests
Reported orders and requests are very similar to the rest of reported speech – however the verbs change again. Reported orders use **told** as the reporting verb, and reported requests used **asked** as it’s reporting verb. 

> [!example]+ 💡 Example
> 
> Request: “Please may you sit down?” → She asked me to sit down. 
> Command: “Sit down, now.” → She told me to sit down.
