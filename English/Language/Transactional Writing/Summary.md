# Summary
#GR10/Q1 #language #language/writing/transactional-writing 

There are a few things to keep track of in summaries:
- Use key facts only — leave out examples and unnecessary detail
- Express yourself in your own words as briefly as possible — leave out what is redundant or unnecessary and write short sentences
- Sometimes you can save words by joining the meanings of two sentences by using a pronoun such as "who" or "what" as a conjunction
- Check that nothing is repeated
- Your summary should be in the 3<sup>rd</sup> person — no "I" or "we"
- Write in the past tense
- Count the number of words to see that it does not exceed the word-count. Write this *accurate* count at the end of the summary in square brackets at the bottom right of your summary
- Give your summary a title or heading, but it will count towards your word count — leave it out if it is not mentioned in your question
- Pay attention to the *purpose* of your summary
- Always have your summary in the format of *one paragraph*
