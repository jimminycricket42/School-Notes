# Reviews
#GR9 #language/writing 
Reviews are meant to inform or persuade the reader to buy or experience whatever you are reviewing

## Title:
Your title must say what you are reviewing, and includes the name of the piece and its creator, this should be underlined. Below that you should have what kind of review it is (positive, negative, neutral) in the subtitle. Below that is the date and the reviewers name.

### Things to include:
-   Name of piece and the author.
-   The type of review (positive, negative, neutral)
-   The date the review was written.
-   The name of the reviewer.

## Introduction
In the introduction, you should tell the reader what you are reviewing, and your experience of the book. This should only be two or three sentences long. it should give more information about the book (i.e.. when it was made, is it part of a series, etc.)

## Body
Your body consists of two or three paragraphs, and goes over what you liked about the book, what you didn't like, and why. It is very important to substantiate your opinions, as this gives your review credibility. These paragraphs are there to persuade your reader that the book is a good/bad book, and give them enough information for them to make an informed decision on whether to read the book or not. You should use [[Explanatory language]] to link and form well-structured arguments as to why you did/did not enjoy a novel. 

### Things to include:
-   Introduction of characters
-   Your opinions
-   An objective view of the book
-   Persuasive language
-   Strong connectors
-   Strong topic sentences

### Introducing characters

When introducing a character, state their full name, and what relevance they have to the story. This is just a short overview and is a really general overview. You only need to do this once, and afterwards you can refer to them by their first name.

### Opinions

If you are stating one of your own opinions, you must make that known, either by saying “i think” or “My opinion is” or a similar statement. You must substantiate your opinions. This can be done by telling the reader how that improved or worsened the story.

Opinions are both praise and critique. They can celebrate the good parts of a text, or they can point out flaws that can be remedied. To have a non-biased review you must find and substantiate an equal amount of critiques and praises.

### Objective views

Objective views are unbiased, critical views on a subject. In the case of books, it is looking at the writing style, content, plot, and substance of the book. Objective views contain no personal preferences, and do not change if you liked or disliked the book.

### Persuasive Language

The point of your review is to convince the reader that the book is either good or bad. We use persuasive language to do that. One of the most powerful types of persuasive writing is emotive language. This is language that makes the reader feel a certain way. It also makes your text more interesting to read, and easier to understand.

### Connectors

The way you join your text is very important. If there is no logical connection, then it seems messy, unstructured, and disorganised. There are certain words we call connectors, and they can help make your review easier to read.

### Topic sentences

A topic sentence is a sentence that gives the main idea of something. Having good topic sentences helps inform your reader. If you look through this document, there are many topic sentences that make sure that you, the reader, know what i am talking about.

## Conclusion

The conclusion is the cherry on top of a great review. It is short, and very important. You should tell your readers the style of the review (whether it is positive, negative, or neutral). You should also suggest your piece's target market. Finally, you must have the “just” of the review, which is just a basic [[summary]] of your main points from the body of your review.
