## Ambiguity
Ambiguity is when a phrase or sentence has more than one interpretation, or the meaning is unclear. This creates confusion as to the meaning of the writing.

> [!example]+ 💡 Example
> 
> *Incorrect*: If the baby does not like cold milk, boil it.
> *Correct*: If the baby does not like drinking cold milk, boil the milk first.
>
> In the first statement the reader could interpret the sentence as; “Boil the baby.” or “Boil the milk." Furthermore, it is unclear what the baby does with the cold milk, and why the baby dislikes it.
> Here we clarify the relationship between the verbs and the subject + object. “The baby does not like drinking cold milk, boil the milk first.”

## Malapropism
Malapropism is the incorrect use of a word, often due to confusion.

> [!example]+ 💡 Example
> 
> *Incorrect*: ”In the Australian outback, you may be attacked by an allegory.”
> *Correct*: “In the Australian outback, you may be attacked by an alligator.”

## Misrelated Participle
A misrelated participle occurs when there is ambiguity that occurs when the participle phrase refers to the wrong noun. It is also known as a dangling participle.

> [!example]+ 💡 Example
> 
> *Incorrect*: “I took a picture flying into Heathrow”
> *Correct*: “As I was flying into Heathrow, I took a picture of big ben.”; “Whilst I was flying into Heathrow, I took a picture of Big Ben.”
> 
> The participle “flying” can be confused here, hence the ambiguity. “Flying” can mean:
> -   The person was taking a photo of something else while they were flying into Heathrow.
> -   The person took a photo of Heathrow while he was flying.
> 
> It is also ambiguous because we do not know what object he is taking a photo of.
> We clarify the object and the verb in this sentence, and link the two sentences with a conjunction in order to “close” the dangling participle

## Sentence Fragments
Sentences require a subject and a finite verb. A sentence fragment is a group of words that are missing a subject or a verb.

> [!example]+ 💡 Example
> 
> *Incorrect*: “All on my own”
> *Correct*: “I was all on my own”
> 
> “All on my own” has no subject. A reader cannot understand the sentence from that phrase alone. So we add a subject and an auxiliary verb to give context.

## Concord
Concord is the agreement between the words that are used in a sentence. Concord errors occur when verbs or pronouns are incorrectly used in a sentence.

> [!example]+ 💡 Example
> 
> *Incorrect*: My new bike are special.
> *Correct*: My new bike is special.
> 
> The verb and the subject disagree because the subject is singular and the verb is plural. The verb is incorrectly conjugated (see [[conjugation]] notes). We change the verb to correct the concord.

> [!example]+ 💡 Example
> 
> *Incorrect*: One must do her work.
> *Correct*: She must do her work.
> 
> The pronouns in this sentence do not match up. “One” and “her” do not agree. In order to correct this, we change “one” to “she”.

## Tautology
Tautology is the unnecessary repetition of a phrase or idea in a text. As a result, some words become ‘pointless’ and can confuse the reader. This is also know as redundancy.

> [!example]+ 💡 Example
> 
> *Incorrect*: I myself feel that this is a total waste of time.
> *Correct*: I feel that this is a waste of time.
>
> While the first sentence isn’t incorrect, it is wordy and hard to read. The second sentence gets rid of the unnecessary words and conveys the same meaning.

## Verbosity and Circumlocution
Circumlocution means to say something in a very roundabout way. Verbosity is using more words than necessary. This is done to make someone seem ‘clever’ however it is impractical. Pompous language can make you sound pretentious, and can cause a text to lose it’s meaning. Saying things concisely and accurately prevents this.

> [!example]+ 💡 Example
> 
> *Incorrect*: I was perusing your initial, preliminary draft of your essay and I was aghast at the use of elevated, mature language.
> *Correct*: I read the rough draft of your essay and I was impressed by your use of language.
> 
> The first sentence is not grammatically incorrect, however it is hard to read and harder to understand. The second sentence cuts down on unnecessary words, and replaces uncommon phrases with more well-known and understandable phrases.

## Cliché
Cliché is the overuse of a theme or idea throughout common media to the extent where it is no longer original.

> [!example]+ 💡 Example
> 
> *Incorrect*: Money doesn’t grow on trees.
> *Correct*: People need to learn the value of hard work and reward.

## Mixed metaphors
A metaphor is a comparison between two things that share a common characteristic. Whilst metaphors can enhance your writing, two or more metaphors used together can create confusion. Metaphors that do not sync or work together are called mixed metaphors.

> [!example]+ 💡 Example
> 
> *Incorrect*: when he let the cat out of the bag about the surprise party, it really rained on everyone’s parade.
> *Correct*: when he let the cat out of the bag about the surprise party, it spoilt the occasion for everyone.
>
> The first statement is correct, but is hard to understand. We simplify it by removing the second metaphor and replacing it with a more understandable sentence
