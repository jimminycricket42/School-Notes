# The Conch
The conch is a seashell that the boys found in their first days on the beach. It is used to call all the boys out of the jungle and on to the beach – the first official meeting on the island. From here the conch is used to create order, and represents the leader of the schoolboys. ^blurb

The person who holds the conch in a meeting is allowed to speak – something that Jack and Ralph both abuse to silence the little’uns. 

## Symbolism of the conch
**Leadership**
The conch is carried by the leader of the island. 

**Communication**
Using the conch the boys and little’uns can communicate through meetings and calls – something that only changes when Jack steals the conch. 

**Civility**
The conch prevents everyone from talking over one another, and allows for discussions to be held. It also identifies a leader of the group, which is important for organizing everyone.
