# Ralph
Ralph is the protagonist of the Lord of the Flies, however he is a flawed protagonist. He is a strong, charismatic leader, but he is not well developed and lacks the [[Themes of the Lord of the Flies#^Wisdom|wisdom]] to properly lead the islanders. He is unable to diffuse the conflict with [[Jack]], and later unable to protect [[Piggy]]. ^blurb

Ralph and Piggy represent the struggle for democracy and order on the island, and [[The Conch]] is the most powerful symbol of this. Ralph is the carrier of the conch, showing him as the leader. During meetings, [[Jack]] repeatedly takes [[The Conch]] from Piggy, showing how [[Themes of the Lord of the Flies#^Power-and-Leadership|power]] can be given and taken, as well as the theme of [[Themes of the Lord of the Flies#^Degradation-of-others]].
