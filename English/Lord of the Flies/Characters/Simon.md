# Simon
Simon is a compassionate and kind boy. He has the most positive outlook on the boy’s situation. He is not very social, and prefers to go to his calm jungle spot. He doesn’t fit into the world that the others created on the island.  ^blurb

Simon is younger than [[Ralph]], [[Piggy]] and [[Jack]], but he is older than the little’uns. This further serves to alienate him from the islanders. 

Simon’s gentle kindness is reminiscent of Jesus, playing into the repetitive religious imagery, and the dynamic of Ralph and Jack being like Abel and Cain. 

Later in the book, Simon has an epileptic fit when he sees the staked pig’s head.
