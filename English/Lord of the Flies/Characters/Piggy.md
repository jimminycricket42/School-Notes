# Piggy
Piggy is the most level-headed and intelligent of the boys, however, he lacks social skills. He is a poor leader, rather falling into the role of adviser to [[Ralph]]. He is constantly teased as short and fat, and he lacks physical strength. Because of this, he holds closely to society, democracy, and science. He is the smartest boy on the island, and he leverages that to remain relevant. ^blurb

[[Piggy's Glasses]] represent clear sight, and Piggyâ€™s constant cleaning of them shows his desire for clarity. It also helps show how he values society, as the glasses represent society. In the book, [[Jack]] punches Piggy, breaking one of the lenses. This [[Prolepsis|foreshadows]] [[Jack]] stealing the glasses later, making Piggy almost entirely blind.
