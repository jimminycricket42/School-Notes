# Jack
Jack is an aggressive antagonist who is a part of the major conflict on the island. He is a strong leader, but leads with fear unlike [[Ralph]]. He forces the choir boys into hunting the pigs on the island, which hastens their descent into savagery. His violence breaks [[Piggy's Glasses]], and later he forces Ralph out of leadership. ^blurb

Early on, his uniform has a snake clasp on it, which represents his evil nature. Additionally, he is one of the islanders that finds [[The Pig's Head]].
