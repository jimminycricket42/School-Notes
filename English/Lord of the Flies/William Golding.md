# William Golding
1911 – 1983

William Golding wrote “The Lord of the Flies” as a response to the lighthearted optimism of “Coral Island”. His intent was to portray a more realistic version of life after crashing on an island. 

## Schoolboys
> I think women are foolish to pretend they are equal to men. They are far superior and always have been – *William Golding*

William Golding used schoolboys as the main characters of “The Lord of the Flies”. This is because boys have yet to be so strictly taught the rules of society, and therefore are more likely to fall into the savagery shown within Lord of the Flies. They know enough to form rules and structures, but they are quickly broken. 

There is a massive tragedy in the loss of innocence within the boys during their descent into savagery. Their youth is replaced by basal instincts. and their civility and morality is thrown aside for instincts and violence. This mirrors the experiences of Golding in WW2. 

## Golding and WW2
Golding served and fought in WW2, where he saw the worst of human savagery and survival instincts. Additionally he lived through the cold war, a time of fear. This book served as a warning to the governments of the world of what kind of destruction could occur if we give in to violence and ignore our morality. This is shown through the [[Themes of the Lord of the Flies]]. 

Additionally, Lord of the Flies seems to be set during WW2.
