# Allegory in the Lord of the Flies
The Lord of the Flies contains two types of allegory:
- Political allegory
- Religious Allegory 

## Political Allegory
Lord of the Flies mirrors certain events that occurred in World War 2. The divided camps of the boys mirrors the division of the world, and in both cases these divisions lead to destruction. The fire at the end of the book is meant to represent the atom bombs, and the dangers of releasing destructive forces on the world. The small-scale war of the boys almost ends in that fire, but an adult arrives and saves them, representing how society and order is the only thing keeping the world from disaster. 

## Religious Allegory
The island represents the Garden of Eden – a paradise that was lost when it’s inhabitants succumbed to evil and gave in to their impulses. The beast is what causes this shift in behaviour, and it mirrors the snake of eden, while the parachutist (which is what inspired the beast in the boy’s mind) represents the fall of mankind. Even the main characters are representative of biblical characters – such as Ralph representing Abel and Jack representing Cain, or Simon representing Jesus.
