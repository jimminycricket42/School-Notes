# Film Comparison: 1974 vs 2013
#GR10/Q2 #poems-and-prose/Gatsby/character #poems-and-prose/Gatsby/movies #poems-and-prose/analysis 

*Question:* Of the two films (1974 – Jack Clayton, 2013 – Baz Luhrmann), which is more successful at capturing the themes, moods, and characters of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel: *The Great Gatsby*.

## Characters
*Main Characters:* [[Character List#Nick|Nick]], [[Character List#Gatsby|Gatsby]], [[Character List#Daisy|Daisy]], [[Character List#Jordan|Jordan]], [[Character List#Tom|Tom]], [[Character List#Myrtle Wilson|Myrtle]]

### Nick
I preferred Luhrmann’s version of Nick. He was more expressive and more involved as a character. Luhrmann’s Nick seemed like the moral-midwestern-narrator that the book told us of. I also feel that the 1974 version lacks the depiction of bias and emotion that the book and Luhrmann’s version has. 

### Gatsby
Gatsby’s look is better captured in the 1974 version, but his grandeur, character, and richness is better in Baz Luhrmann’s version. In Luhrmann’s film, Gatsby is far more of a romantic, and he feels larger than life with his exorbitant parties and obsessive nature. In Claytons film, he has less intrigue, but the actor Robert Redfield looks like a rich man. 

### Daisy
The 1974 version of Daisy has an angelic and gentle aesthetic, which I feel is far more fitting for Daisy. She is almost always put in [[Film Shot types|soft focus]], which helps with this feeling. However, I feel her character lacks the emotional depth of the Baz Luhrmann’s version. Baz Luhrmann’s Daisy is a romantic who is unhappy in her relationship, and is in love with Gatsby very quickly, and you can pick that up even if you didn’t hear the dialogue. 

### Jordan
Baz Luhrmann’s Jordan is forgettable, as in I literally forgot about her character traits and her role in his movie. She is so plain, and is treated as an object and a plot device instead of a character. She captured the high-and-mighty detachment of Jordan from the book, but complete misses the vulnerability and sheer sex appeal. Her attitude is glossed over, and she never warms up to Nick as she does in the book. She doesn’t have the excitement, the wonder, or the allure of the 1974 Jordan. Jack Clayton had the better idea of how Jordan grew over the course of the book, and showed that. The actor, Lois Chiles, really captures the high-society sexiness of Jordan. 

### Tom 
Tom is far, far better in the Baz Luhrmann version of the film. He is more brutish, more aggressive, and the actor is closer to hulking than the Clayton version of the film. The Clayton version focuses too much on his vulnerability as a man, and does not give enough attention to his ego and overconfidence. 

### Myrtle
Neither representation of Myrtle really portray her character in the book. In the book she is lively and sensual, but in the movies shes very… flat. Baz Luhrmann gave her a very colourful outfit, and had her act more alive.
