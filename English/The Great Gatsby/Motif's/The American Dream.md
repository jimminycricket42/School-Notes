# The American Dream

> The American dream is the belief that anyone, regardless of where they were born or what class they were born into, can attain their own version of success in a society in which upward mobility is possible for everyone.

In the Great Gatsby we keep seeing the failures of the American Dream, such as [[Character List#Tom|Tom's lack of fulfilment]], [[Character List#George Wilson|George's lack of will, and his living conditions]], and the gangsterism and racism that is represented by [[Character List#Mr Wolfsheim|Mr. Wolfsheim and Gatsby's dealings]]. Furthermore the [[The Valley Of Ashes]] shows the dreary, corrupted side of the American dream, while the [[The Class-division of New York]] shows the large differences between those with money and those without money.
