# The Valley Of Ashes
#GR10/Q1  #poems-and-prose/gatsby/recurring-theme 

The valley separates the [[The Class-division of New York|classes of the west and east egg's]]. It represents the disintegration of [[the American dream]], the growth of an ugly underbelly, filled with moral decay. Yet this terrible side of the American dream is hidden by the glamour and wealth of the West- and East- egg.
In the valley of ashes, there are the "Eyes of doctor T.J. Eckleberg." this is billboard for an old get-rich-quick optometrist scheme. Now, the billboard 'watches' over the valley, judging those beneath it, as if they were the eyes of god.
