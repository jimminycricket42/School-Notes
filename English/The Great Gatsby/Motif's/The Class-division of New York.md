# The Class Division of New York
#GR10/Q1 #poems-and-prose/gatsby/recurring-theme 
The West- and East- egg are separated by a body of water, and the eggs from the rest of New York.
This class division is apparent from how Gatsby spends his money (partying, spending, etc.) vs how Tom spends his money (Polo ponies, houses, etc.)
It is also apparent between Tom and his Mistress, [[Character List#Myrtle|Myrtle]]. Tom can hit Myrtle, and make fun of [[Character List#Myrtle|Myrtle]] husband, and take her out to buy clothes and dogs and presents, but Myrtle isn't allowed to speak about Daisy at all.
