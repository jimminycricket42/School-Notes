# Nick as the Narrator
#GR10/Q1  #poems-and-prose/gatsby/character 
Nick is a reliable narrator, simply because he is a coward. He is too afraid to make decisions that affect his story, and as such 'separates' himself from the story. This allows him to give unbiased descriptions of others actions, but causes him to fall short when it comes to providing insight. Furthermore, it draws attention his own feelings and thoughts towards other, as is made apparent by his descriptions of Daisy, [[Character List#Tom|Tom]], Charlette, and [[Character List#Jordan|Jordan]].

## Argument for Nick being Reliable: 
- *[[The Great Gatsby (text).pdf#page=1|Nick reserves all judgement]]*:, and he tries to be more compassionate and objective, rather waiting to make a judgement of Gatsby opposed to believing the rumors. 
- *[[Mid-West values]]:* Nick has strong family values, as is shown by his aunts and uncles involvement in the decision for him to move to New York.
- *Elevated register:* we trust Nick's recollection of events because he writes like man.
- *Compassion:* Nick felt sorry for [[Character List#Daisy|Daisy]] and the situation she is in.  
- *Descriptions:* Nick makes judgements of others, but he still tries to paint a fair picture of them, as he did with [[Character List#Tom|Tom]] and [[Character List#Myrtle|Myrtle]].
- *Reflection:* Nick goes back and reflects on what he has wrote, and reflects on what he has wrote and the validity of it as he did at the  [[The Great Gatsby (text).pdf#page=61|end of Chapter 3]].
- *Motif: [[Windows|Nick and windows]]:* Nick is often surrounded by windows - so much so that we can call it a recurring motif. This is done to show that he is an observer, he isn't entirely 'in' his life, which gives him a unique perspective of the world around him

## Arguments for Nick being Unreliable
- *Reserves judgement:* Nick often takes the moral high ground, as he does when he is drunk with [[Character List#Tom|Tom]] and [[Character List#Myrtle|Myrtle]], and he does not believe he can be as immoral as they are. This is again shown when he sees [[Character List#Jordan|Jordan]] eavesdropping on Tom's [[The Great Gatsby (text).pdf#page=18|call to his mistress]]. 
- *Naïve:* Nick is naïve due to his midwestern background, and he doesn't fully grasp just how amoral the people around him are being.
- *Bias diction*:
	- [[Character List#Tom|Tom]]: "Hulking" "arrogant"
	- [[Character List#Jordan|Jordan]]: "Dishonest"
- *First person view:* Nick is not omnipresent and this limits the scope of his observations and insights
