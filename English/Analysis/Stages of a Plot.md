# Stages of a Plot
Plots consist of common elements. Not every story has every component, but all of them have a place and a time. ^blurb

Plots commonly consist of: 
- Exposition – reveal of characters and setting
- Rising action – set up the conflict and the characters
- Conflict
- Climax
- Falling Action
- Denouement (Resolution)

## Exposition
The exposition is the revealing of the characters and setting, as well as setting the basis for the action that is going to occur. 

## Rising Action
The rising action is responsible for further developing the characters, as well as introducing the conflict. It is essential for building tension and creating a worthwhile climax. 

## Conflict
The conflict is the driving force for the plot – what do the characters need to defeat/overcome/discover. Conflict comes in many forms, such as a macguffin, a big bad evil guy (BBEG), internal development, fear, trauma, etc. 

## Climax 
The climax is the high of the book, it is where the conflict is dealt with by the characters. It is not always a long section – nor does it need to be short. 

## Falling Action
The falling action is where the climax has been finished and the characters are dealing with the aftermath. 

## Denouement (Resolution)
The Resolution is where the characters are setting off for new adventures – finding new paths – or simply taking a rest. Sometimes the resolution can end openly, or can be cut to create a cliffhanger.
