# Character Analysis
#GR9 #reading/analysis 

A character is defined as a person in a novel, play, or film. We look at what is being said, and why is it being said. We want to determine the authors purpose, and outline the characters actions.

## Character
- What kind of character?
- How do they act and gesture, how do they walk talk and sit?
- Anything that your character specifically does?

### Vocal and physical characteristics
- How do they speak? Does their voice change with their emotions?
- How do we interpret their emotions within the play?

### Speech patterns
- Does your character speak in specific ways to show their age, education, or culture?
    
### Attitudes
- What ideas and thoughts does your character hold of the world around them, the events and people that occur in the play?
- How do they show these thoughts through their actions and emotions?
    
### Functions - context
- Why is this character in the play?
- What purpose do they serve?
- What is their importance and where does the monologue take place?
- How does this affect the characters actions, or other characters actions?
    
### Specific mannerisms
- What is unique to that character that makes them a character and not just a figure?
- What do they do regularly?

## Objective/viewpoint
- What does the character want? And what is their attitude about it?
- What will the character do to get their goals? What limits do they have?

## Obstacle
- Is there something preventing the characters goals? How will they deal with it?

## Conflict
- Arises when the character faces an obstacle and needs to take action. It can be internal or external conflict.

## Resolution
- the decision or action taken by the character to resolve the drama
