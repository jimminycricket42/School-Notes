# Film Shot types
Films are made up of scenes, which are in turn made up of sequences, which are in turn made up of, shots. These shots tell the story through the eyes of the director, as they want to show the audience. ^blurb

## Angles
the angle of the camera can enhance the relationship of the viewer to the focus in many ways. often it is subconscious, but it still has an enormous effect on the viewer. it gives the photographer/cinematographer a way to influence the viewers judgement of the character. the more intense the angle, the more symbolic the shot can be.

### birds eye view
the shot is taken from right above the actor. it can create a sense of chaos, as it a very unnatural view. it can make an actor small, and familiar things unrecognisable. just as it can estrange the audience, it can make them feel like the actor is part of a wider scheme of things

### high
is taken from above the actors eye level. it isn't as extreme as the birds eye view, but it gives a general overview. it can make things seem smaller, and less powerful, or less scary. the object or character are also 'swallowed up' by the scene, and makes them more a part of it

### eye level
is taken at the actors eye level. eye level is a very neutral shot, not making the characters seem more or less powerful, but rather raising the audience up to their level.

### low angle
is taken from below the actors eye level. this makes the character\object bigger and more powerful, as well as minor confusion. often the background will not have much detail, as its either a roof or the sky.

### worms eye view
is taken from directly below the actor. it causes the same chaos as the high angle, but it has the added bonus of making a character seem extremely powerful

### cantered
is taken at a tilt. this insinuates transition, or instability. it is sometimes meant to show a point of view of a specific character.

## Lengths

the length you are filming at is basically how much you can see in a shot. it ranges from extremely close to very far away. below is the names and descriptions of different lengths

### Establishing shot
These are extreme magnifications that you would not see in real life, they are meant to create emphasis on a certain object. it fully cuts out the background, and the object you wish to emphasize take up the entire frame.

### extreme close up
a close up focuses mainly on the face of a character, and shows emotion. it shows very little background, usually blurring it to a high extent. it also magnifies an object, and gives it importance.

### close up
this shot positions the camera over the back of a character, generally showing parts of the back of their head. it shows a point of view, or makes the viewer feel like they're secretly listening to a conversation.

### over the shoulder shot
it shows from between the knees to the waist up on a character, its often used in things like YouTube videos, and is used to show facial expression and body language. its also often used for conversations. there are 2 variations of this, a 2 shot and a 3 shot, which show 2 and three characters respectively. any more than that and the shot usually becomes a long shot. background detail is also minimal, as the scene should have been set earlier in the movie.

### medium shot
these shots show the full body of a character, with details in the background visible. in general, if you can see both the feet and head of something, then its a long shot.

### long shot
also known as an extreme long shot, it shows the place in which action will take place, its sets the scene that action will take place in. it will normally show the exterior, and will not have extreme detail. its meant to give a general impression opposed to details
