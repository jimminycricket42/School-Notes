# Phagocytes
Phagocytes are responsible for the engulfing and ingesting pathogens in a process called *phagocytosis*. They are very large [[Blood#Leukocytes (White Blood Cells)|white blood cells]] in order to fully engulf agglutinated clumps of pathogens. ^blurb

Phagocytes are reliant on [[Antibodies]] to determine what they should and should not ingest.
