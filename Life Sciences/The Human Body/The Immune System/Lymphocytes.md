# lymphocytes
Lymphocytes are the cells responsible for the detection and destruction of pathogenic [[Microorganisms]]. They occur in the lymph glands, spleen, and blood.  ^blurb


> [!tip]- :star_struck: Extra: Creation of Lymphocytes and Phagocytes
> Lymphocytes and phagocytes start as undifferentiated stem cells in the [[Bones|red bone marrow]]. From there, B-lymphocytes will grow in the red bone marrow and T-lymphocytes in the Thymus gland. When fully grown, they will move to the [[Lymphatic System]] such as tonsils, lymph nodes, and spleen. 

## B-Lymphocytes
B-lymphocytes are responsible for preventing pathogens from entering and infecting cells. They work within the lymphatic fluid in conjunction with antigens and phagocytes to effectively contain and terminate pathogens. 

B-lymphocytes have receptor proteins attached to their surface to identify antigens. Once they detect the antigen, they replicate rapidly and produce [[Antibodies]].

After the infection is cleared, some B-lymphocytes remain in the lymphatic system as memory cells so that when the same disease is encountered again, the body can have a more rapid response. This is what allows humans to become immune to a pathogen after being infected once. It is the basis of [[Immunity]]

## T-Lymphocytes
T-lymphocytes are more aggressive and are responsible for removing pathogens that have entered the [[The Cell|Cells]] of the body. [[#B-Lymphocytes]] cannot reach pathogens within cells. T-lymphocytes can detect and destroy the pathogens within cells. This is done by 3 cells:
- Helper T-cells
- Killer T-cells
- Suppressor T-cells

### Helper T-cells
Helper T-cells are the main detectors of pathogens within cells. They attach to the antigens and notify the Killer T-cells that it is there. They start the immune response of T-Lymphocytes. They are also activated faster if memory B-cells are activated to contain an infection. 

### Killer T-cells
Killer T-cells attach to an infected cell and deposit a chemical named perforin into a cell that causes holes to form in the cellâ€™s membrane, killing it and the pathogen within. 

### Suppressor T-cells
Once an infection is clear of pathogens suppressor t-cells are activated to stop the killer T-cells from continuing to destroy cells. When this fails, it is known as an autoimmune disease.
