# Antibodies
Antibodies are structures produced by [[Lymphocytes]] that play a vital role in the destruction of pathogens. Some antibodies simply cause pathogen cells to burst, while others alert [[Phagocytes]] that then ingest and destroy the pathogens. Additionally, antibodies *agglutinate* pathogens so phagocytes can remove them more effectively. ^blurb

> When a pathogen is agglutinated by an antibody, it is deactivated and can no longer infect cells. It is then grouped together with other pathogens with the same antigens through the antibodies, creating a clump of pathogens for phagocytes to ingest. ^agglutination

Antibodies are produced by [[Lymphocytes]] whenever they detect foreign antigens.
