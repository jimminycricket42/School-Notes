# The Functioning of the Heart
[[The Structure of the Heart|The heart]] has the property of *automatism*, meaning that it can automatically contract and relax without outside stimuli. Each time [[The Structure of the Heart|the heart]] goes through the cardiac cycle, there is a heartbeat. 

Doctors use a *stethoscope* to amplify the sound of the heartbeat. Each cycle has a “lub dub” sound that is formed when the [[The Structure of the Heart#Valves of the Heart valves-of-the-heart|Valves of the heart]] close. The “lub” sound comes from the AV-valves and the “dub” sound comes from the closing of the semi-lunar valves. 

## The Cardiac Cycle
Every 0,8secs [[The Structure of the Heart|the heart]] goes through one *cardiac cycle*. The cardiac cycle encompasses all changes to [[The Structure of the Heart|the heart]] that occur during *one full heartbeat*. The cardiac cycle consists of: 
- Atrial Systole (Contraction) 
- Ventricular Systole (Contraction)
- General Diastole (Relaxation)

### Atrial Systole (0,1 sec)
Both atria are filled with [[Blood]] and *contract simultaneously*, forcing the [[Blood]] into the *ventricles*. The *AV-valves are open*, and *no more [[Blood]] is coming into [[The Structure of the Heart|the heart]]* because the Vena-cava and the pulmonary veins are closed. 

### Ventricular Systole (0,3 sec)
Both Ventricles have now been filled. They contract simultaneously, pushing the [[Blood]] to the [[Lungs]] through the semi-lunar valves and into the *Aorta* and the *Pulmonary Artery*. In this process the AV-Valves are closed, and [[The Structure of the Heart|the heart]] is emptied of [[Blood]]. 

### General Diastole (0,4 sec)
All [[Muscles]] of [[The Structure of the Heart|the heart]] relax and [[Blood]] flows into [[The Structure of the Heart|the heart]]. The AV-valves are open and blood flows in. 

## How does the [[The Structure of the Heart|heart]] beat?
The Heart relies on the *SA node* to be it’s pacemaker. The SA node is a group of *specialised muscle cells* that initiate the impulses for contraction that then travel through the heart along more specialised muscle cells, the bundles of His and the Purkinje fibres. These allow fast and effective conduction of impulses within the heart, and enables *automatism* of the heart. 

The rate of the heart beat is determined by the brain and by hormonal changes. The Autonomic Nervous System controls the heartbeat by sending impulses along two different types of nerves: The *sympathetic nerves* and the *parasympathetic nerves*:
- Sympathetic Nerves: Speeds up the the tempo of the heartbeat
- Parasympathetic Nerves: Slows down the the tempo of the heartbeat
Additionally, the hormones *adrenaline* and *thyroxin* speed up the heartrate in different circumstances. 

### Effects of Exercise on the heartbeat
During exercise, the muscles require more energy and therefore perform [[Respiration|cellular respiration]] more, leading to increase in CO<sub>2</sub> into the blood. This gives a signal to *chemoreceptors*, which in turn tell the brain that it must instruct the heart to beat faster, pumping more blood to the [[Lungs]] for [[Gaseous Exchange]] to occur, removing the CO<sub>2</sub> and replacing it with O<sub>2</sub>. 

> [!note]+ Pulse Rate
> Pulse rate is the amount of times the arteries pulse, in time with the heartbeat. This can be measured in any artery close to the surface of your skin, such as in the wrist, or the carotid arteries in your neck.
