# The Structure of the Heart
The heart is the centre of our circulatory system. It is found directly below the *sternum*, in a cavity between [[Lungs|the lungs]] known as the *mediastinum*. This allows it to be protected by the ribs and the sternum. It forms a part of the organs in [[The Thoracic Cavity]]. The heart is kept in place by the large blood vessels that enter and leave it, such as: the aorta, the vena-cava, and the pulmonary veins and arteries. 

The heart is a double-pump made up of [[Cardiac Muscle]] that moves [[Blood]] throughout the body, including to the [[Lungs]] and the [[Nutrition in the Human body|digestive system]]. The heart is one of our *vital organs*, and it provides [[The Cell|cells]]

## External Structure of the Heart

>Anatomical Diagrams are drawn as if you are looking down at the heart, so right and left are flipped. 

On the outside of the heart there is [[Cardiac Muscle]] tissue which can contract autonomously. This property is called *automatism*, and makes the heart a unique organ within our bodies. These [[Muscles]] are supplied with [[Blood]] by the *coronary blood vessels*, which drain directly into the right atrium.

The heart is enclosed by a double-walled membrane named the *pericardium*. This membrane has a watery-fluid between its inner and outer layer that *prevents [[Electrostatics#Triboelectric charging through friction|friction]]* between the heart and the surrounding organs whenever the heart contracts. 

## Interior Structure of the Heart

>[!note]- Remember: Flipped Diagrams  
>Anatomical Diagrams are drawn as if you are looking down at the heart, so right and left are flipped. 

The interior of the heart is split into left and right by *the septum*. The septum ensures that *oxygenated and deoxygenated [[Blood]] do not mix*. 

The left side of the heart is filled with oxygenated [[Blood]]. The right side of the heart is filled with deoxygenated [[Blood]]. Because the two sides of the heart pump different [[Blood]] from different sources, we can say that the heart is a *double pump*. 

### Chambers of the Heart
The heart is divided into a total of four chambers. Each side of the heart has an *atrium* and a *ventricle*. These Chambers pump at certain intervals to form [[The Functioning of the Heart#The Cardiac Cycle|Cardiac Cycle]]. 

The atria are responsible for *receiving [[Blood]]*, and are thinner with less muscle. 

The ventricles are responsible for *pumping [[Blood]]*, and have more muscle to pump more [[Blood]].

> The thickest muscle wall of the heart is the muscle of the left ventricle, as it must pump [[Blood]] to the entire body

#### The Right Atrium (RA)
The Right Atrium is responsible for *receiving* the *deoxygenated [[Blood]] from the body*. The [[Blood]] comes in through the *superior and inferior vena cava*. The superior vena cava drains the head and upper body, while the inferior vena cava drains the legs and abdomen. 

#### Right Ventricle (RV)
The right ventricle is responsible for pumping deoxygenated [[Blood]] to the [[Lungs]] through the *pulmonary arteries*. This [[Blood]] comes in from the [[#Atrio-Ventricular Valves AV Valves|Tricuspid Valve]] found in the atrio-ventricular opening. This valve prevents [[Blood]] from moving back into the atrium when the ventricle contracts and ensures it moves into the pulmonary arteries. 

#### Left Atrium
The left atrium is responsible for receiving oxygenated [[Blood]] from [[Lungs|the lungs]] through the *pulmonary veins*. 

#### Left Ventricle
The left ventricle is responsible for pumping oxygenated [[Blood]] to the rest of the body. It is the largest chamber of the heart with the thickest muscular wall, as it has to pump the most [[Blood]] the furthest distance. The [[Blood]] comes in from the [[#Atrio-Ventricular Valves AV Valves|Bicuspid Valve]] found in the atrio-ventricular opening. The [[Blood]] is them pumped through the aorta to the rest of the body. 

### Valves of the Heart 
#### Semi-Lunar Valves
![[Semi-lunar valves.jpg]]
Semi-lunar valves are found at the base of the pulmonary artery and the Aorta, and are meant to stop [[Blood]] from flowing back into the heart. 

They have a half-moon structure that closes when [[Blood]] fills their “sacks” between the [[Blood]]-vessel wall and the flaps. These flaps are pressed against the wall whenever [[Blood]] flows in the correct direction. 

>[!note]+ Semi-lunar valves in other places
>Semi-lunar valves are also found in veins to stop backwards flow of [[Blood]] due to gravity. 
#### Atrio-Ventricular Valves (AV Valves)
![[Atrio-ventricular valves.jpg]]
The atrio-ventricular valves are found between the Atria and the Ventricles. There are two different AV Valves, with identical function. The *Bicuspid Valve* is found in the *left* side of the heart, and the *Tricuspid Valve* is found in the *Right* side of the heart.  

The AV Valves consist of flaps attached to the heart walls through chordae tendineae that are rooted in the papillary [[Muscles]]. The chordae tendineae ensure that the flaps of the AV valves aren’t pushed into the atria, as the pressure exerted on them by [[The Functioning of the Heart|Ventricular Systole]] is immense. This pulls the chordae Tendineae taught whenever the valve is closed by the pressure of the blood pushing against it.
