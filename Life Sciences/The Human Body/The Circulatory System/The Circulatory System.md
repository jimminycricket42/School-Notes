# The Circulatory System
The human circulatory system is a closed [[Blood]] circulatory system, meaning [[Blood]] is only found within the [[Blood Vessels]]. This allows to effectively circulate resources and waste around the body though the usage of [[Blood]], the liquid Connective Tissue. The [[Blood]] is one of three components of the human circulatory system:
- [[Blood]]
- [[Blood Vessels]]
- [[The Structure of the Heart|The Heart]]

> [!info]- Fun Fact: Which organ needs the most blood?
> The organs that need the most blood  are: 
> 1. [[The Liver]]
> 2. The kidneys
> 3. The brain. 
> 
> Technically, the [[Muscles]] use more [[Blood]] than the brain, but because they are not considered organs they do not rank on this list

## Double Circulatory System
Our Body has two cycles of [[Blood]], the Pulmonary circulation and the Systemic circulation. The Pulmonary circulation goes from [[The Structure of the Heart|the heart]], to [[Lungs|the lungs]], and back to [[The Structure of the Heart|the heart]]. The Systemic circulation goes from [[The Structure of the Heart|the heart]], to the body, and back to [[The Structure of the Heart|the heart]].

### Pulmonary Circulation
The [[Blood]] flows from [[The Structure of the Heart|the heart]], to [[Lungs|the lungs]], and back to [[The Structure of the Heart|the heart]]. The deoxygenated [[Blood]] leaves the Right ventricle through the pulmonary artery, where it travels to [[Lungs|the lungs]] and is oxygenated by the [[Alveoli]], and CO<sub>2</sub> is removed. From there it travels back to [[The Structure of the Heart|the heart]] via the pulmonary veins and is received by the left atrium before Joining the Systemic Circulation

### Systemic Circulation
The [[Blood]] flows form [[The Structure of the Heart|the heart]], to [[Lungs|the lungs]], and back to [[The Structure of the Heart|heart]]. The oxygenated [[Blood]] leaves the Left Ventricle through the Aorta, where it travels to the body through Arteries and deposits itâ€™s oxygen in cells, picking up Carbon Dioxide in return. Then it travels back to [[The Structure of the Heart|the heart]] through the veins and re-enters the right atrium from the vena cava before joining the Pulmonary Circulation.
