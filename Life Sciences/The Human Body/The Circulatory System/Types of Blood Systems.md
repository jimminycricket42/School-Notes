# Types of Blood Systems
We look at:
- Open Blood Systems
- Closed Blood Systems

## Open Blood Systems
The blood fills the entire body cavity

Suitable for small organisms without complex organs or lots of blood

Poor circulation leads to poor function

## Closed blood systems
Blood exists in [[Blood Vessels]]

Suitable for large organisms with complex organs and lots of blood

Requires a pump, blood vessels, and capillaries.
