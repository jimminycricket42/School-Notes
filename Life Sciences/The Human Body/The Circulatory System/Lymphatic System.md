# Lymphatic System
The lymphatic system is an extension of your circulatory system that deals with excess blood plasma found in the tissue. The Lymphatic System is an *open circulatory system* responsible for *circulating proteins* that are forced out of [[Blood Vessels|capillaries]] by extreme pressure from the [[The Structure of the Heart|heart]]. It also contains the products of [[Lipids|lipid]] [[Digestion|digestion]].

## Functions of the Lymphatic System
- Drain the Tissue Fluids in the cells
- Removal of Plasma Proteins from around the cell
- Absorption of fats
- Production of Lymphocytes in the [[#Lymph Nodes]]
- Production of Antibodies and white-blood cells
- Circulating large molecules found in the body

## Tissue Fluid
Tissue fluid is [[Blood|blood plasma]] that has been forced through the walls of the capillaries and into the inter-cellular spaces. The tissue fluids absorbs lots of the biproducts of [[Cellular Respiration|cellular respiration]], meaning that it must be put back into the blood stream in order for the lungs to perform [[Gaseous Exchange]]. 

### Movement of the Tissue Fluid
The body moves the tissue fluid using *muscular contractions*, with valves to stop any backflow. The tissue movement is moved to the [[#Lymph Nodes]], where it is filtered and removed of harmful pathogens. 

## Lymph Nodes
Lymph nodes are found in the armpits, the neck, and the hips. Here is where the lymph is filtered of bacteria and pathogens, and where white blood cells are produced.
