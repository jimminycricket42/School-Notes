# Blood Vessels
There are three types of blood vessels with different functions:
- Arteries – Moves [[Blood]] away from [[The Structure of the Heart|The Heart]]
- Capillaries – Allows for [[Gaseous Exchange]] to occur between [[The Cell]] and [[Blood]]
- Veins – Moves [[Blood]] towards [[The Structure of the Heart|The Heart]]

## Arteries
Arteries transport blood away from the heart. Normally this blood is oxygenated, but there are exceptions. 

Arterial walls consist of three layers:
- Outer layer – Made of [[Connective Tissues]]
- Middle layer – Made of [[Smooth Muscle]] and Elastic fibres
- Inner layer – [[Epithelium#Squamous Epithelium|Squamous Epithelium]]

They also have small *lumen* (the central tube of the artery) because of it’s thick muscular wall. The muscular wall allows the artery to stretch and contract, causing the blood to flow easily despite high pressure (and allowing the [[The Functioning of the Heart#^bf6de3|pulse rate]] to appear at certain parts of the body).

The arteries branch out until they end in [[#Capillaries]]. These smaller arteries are called *arterioles*. 

## Capillaries
Capillaries are microscopic tubes that go between organs and *mammalian tissues*. They are so small, it forces [[Blood|red blood cells]] to move through the lumen in a single line, one at a time. They are made up of [[Epithelium|endothelium]], which is one layer thick and allows the exchange of substances to occur between [[Blood|the blood]] and [[The Cell|the cells]]. This also allows [[Gaseous Exchange]] to occur, as the blood moves slow enough for the gasses to diffuse into the cells. 

## Veins
Capillaries eventually reunite into veins in order to move blood back to the heart. 

Venous walls consist of three layers:
- Outer layer – Made of [[Connective Tissues]]
- Middle layer – Made of [[Smooth Muscle]] and Elastic fibres
- Inner layer – [[Epithelium#Squamous Epithelium|Squamous Epithelium]]

This is very similar to arteries, however the outer layer and the middle layer are thinner, allowing for a larger *lumen*. This decreases the pressure in veins, and the muscular walls can no longer move the blood. Instead, veins rely on [[Semi-lunar valves.jpg|semi-lunar valves]] and the [[Skeletal Muscle]] to move the blood back to the heart.
