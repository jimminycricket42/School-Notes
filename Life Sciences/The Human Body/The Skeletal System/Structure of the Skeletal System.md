# Structure of the Skeletal System
The human skeleton consists of 206 [[bones]] in a fully grown adult. Our skeletal system can be separated into two main sections:
- The Axial Skeleton – Contains the trunk of the body, including [[The Thoracic Cavity]], [[Axial Skeleton#The Skull]], and the [[vertebral column]]
- The Appendicular Skeleton – Contains the Pectoral girdle and the upper limps, as well as the pelvic girdle and the lower limbs.
