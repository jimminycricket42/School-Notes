# Joints
A joint is where any two [[Bones]] meet. They are joined by [[Dense Connective Tissue|ligaments]], [[Dense Connective Tissue|tendons]], and [[Cartilage]]. Joints give us mobility so that our body can move. We look at three different types of joints:
- Free-moveable/Synovial Joint – found in the knees, and in the shoulders. 
- Immovable/Fibrous joints – found in the skull and pelvis
- Semi-moveable/Cartilaginous joints – found in-between vertebra and ribs

## Synovial/freely moveable Joints
We have six types of synovial joints:
- Ball-and-socket Joint – Movement in any direction
- Hinge Joint – movement in one plane
- Pivot Joint – Rotational movement
- Gliding Joint – movement in two planes
- Ellipsoid joint – a reduced ball-and socket with limited movement
- Saddle joint – permits 

All synovial joints share a common structure
