# The Appendicular Skeleton
The appendicular skeleton contains all the appendages of the body. The majority of movement occurs in the appendicular skeleton. ^blurb

The appendicular skeleton is made up of four parts:
- The pectoral girdle
- The upper limbs
- The Pelvic Girdle
- The lower limbs

## The Pectoral Girdle
The Pectoral Girdle is the connection point of the upper limbs. 

The shoulder is made up of the scapula at the back and the clavicle at the front. 

The scapula is a flat bone that forms a triangle with a flat ridge at the back for muscle attachment. It slides over the ribcage instead of connecting conventionally. It has a shallow socket known as the *glenoid cavity* that holds the humerus, forming a ball-and-socket joint. 

The clavicle is a long bone that forms an s-shape

## The Pelvic Girdle
The Pelvic Girdle is the connection point of the lower limbs. It is made up by the pelvis.

The pelvis is made of two large irregular bones connected on one side by the [[Axial Skeleton#The Vertebral Column|saccrum]] and on the other side by the *pubic symphysis*. These large bones are made up of three smaller fused bones: the *ilium*, the *ischium*, and the *pubis*.

The *femur* fits into a deep [[Joints|ball and socket joint]] that is called the *acetabulum*.

> Males have smaller pelvic girdles because they do not need to give birth
