# Axial Skeleton
The axial skeleton is the core of the skeleton. The [[appendicular skeleton]] is attached to the axial skeleton. ^blurb

The axial skeleton consists of:
- [[#The Skull]]
- [[#The Vertebral Column]]
- [[#The Rib Cage]]

## The Skull
The skull houses the brain and many of the sensing organs of the body.

The skull consists of the *cranium* and the *facial bones*. It connects to the [[#The Vertebral Column]] through the [[#The Foramen Magnum]]

### Cranium
The cranium is made of 8 flat that are connected by immoveable [[Joints|dovetail joints]]. They enclose and protect the brain in order to protect it. 

### Facial Bones 
There are 15 facial bones that form the features on our faces. These are all [[Bones#Types of Bones|irregular bones]], and all but the jaw are immoveable.

### The Foramen Magnum
The skull connects to the body through the *foramen magnum*, where the [[#The Vertebral Column|spinal cord]] passes through. On either side of the foramen magnum there is a raised bone known as an *articular condyle* which connects with the [[#The Vertebral Column|atlas vertebra]] in order to facilitate *articulation*.

## The Vertebral Column
There are 33 [[Bones]] within the vertebral column known as *vertebra*. They are connected  through [[Dense Connective Tissue|ligaments]] to make a *flexible column*. There are 5 types of vertebra:
- 7 Cervical vertebra
- 12 Thoracic vertebra
- 5 Lumbar vertebra
- 5 Fused Sacral vertebra
- 5 Fused vertebra making the coccyx

### Structure of a Vertebra
All true vertebra have the same general structure:

A *Centrum* connects to a *neural arch* with two outgrowths called *transverse processes*. There is a *hollow tube* between the centrum and the neural arch called the *spinal canal* (or foramen). The foramen contains the *spinal cord*, as well as *cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)*. There are multiple *articular surfaces* that allow for the connection of multiple vertebra, as well as [[#The Rib Cage]]. Between each vertebra there is a [[Cartilage|cartilagenous disc]] to reduce friction. 

All [[Neurons (Nervous Tissue)|nerves]] pass through gaps between the vertebrae.

The first 24 vertebra are true vertebra that are separate bones. The other 9 are fused to form the sacrum and the coccyx

### Functions of the Vertebral Column
- Support [[#The Skull]]
- Protects the spinal cord
- Provides flexibility and shock absorption
- Provides attachment points for the back muscles, [[#The Rib Cage]], and the [[appendicular skeleton|pelvic and pectoral girdles]]

## The Rib Cage
The rib cage forms [[The Thoracic Cavity]]. 

### Structure of the Rib Cage
It is made up of:
- 12 Thoracic Vertebra
- 12 Pairs of ribs – arched [[Bones|flat bones]]
	- The first 7 pairs are true ribs that connect to the sternum
	- The next 3 pairs are false ribs that connect to the preceeding rib
	- The last 2 pairs are floating ribs that are not connected on one end
- The Sternum – dagger-like [[Bones|flat bones]]

### Functions of the rib cage
- Protects [[The Thoracic Cavity]]
- Increases and decreases volume during [[Breathing]]
-
