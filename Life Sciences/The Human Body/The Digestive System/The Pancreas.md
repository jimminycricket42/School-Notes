# The Pancreas
The Pancreas is a  tongue-shaped greyish-pink gland that consists of *pancreatic cells* and *islets of Langerhans*. Pancreatic cells produce pancreatic juice, which plays a vital role in [[Digestion]]. The islets of Langerhans play a large role in [[Homeostasis]] by secreting the hormones Insulin and Glucagon. ^blurb

The pancreas is both an exocrine and an endocrine gland. It is an *exocrine* gland because it secretes it’s own juice, pancreatic juice. It is also an endocrine gland because it secretes hormones directly into the [[Blood|bloodstream]]. 

## Pancreatic Juice
The *pancreatic juice* is secreted into [[The Small Intestine]] through the *[[The Liver|bile duct]]*, and it contains [[enzymes]]. The majority of enzymes found in the [[The Small Intestine#The Duodenum|duodenum]] are produced in the pancreas.

**Contents of Pancreatic Juice**:
- Water
- Bicarbonate [[Electrons]] (to make the pH suitable for the enzymes within)
- [[Enzymes]]
	- Trypsinogen (Inactive form of the trypsin enzyme)
	- Lipase
	- Amylase

## The Pancreas’s Role  in Homeostasis
It plays a large role in [[Homeostasis]] and the [[Homeostasis#Hormonal Control of Glucose Concentration in the Blood|hormonal control of glucose concentration in the blood]].
