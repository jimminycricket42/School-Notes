# The Pancreas
The Pancreas is a  tongue-shaped greyish-pink gland that consists of *pancreatic cells* and *islets of langerhans*. The *pancreatic juice* is secreted into [[The Small Intestine]] through the *[[The Liver#^9543e2|bile duct]]*, and it contains [[enzymes]]. The majority of enzymes found in the [[The Small Intestine#The Duodenum|duodenum]] are produced in the pancreas.  

The pancreas is an *exocrine* gland because it secretes itâ€™s own juice, pancreatic juice. It is also an endocrine gland because it secretes hormones directly into the [[Blood|bloodstream]]

## Contents of Pancreatic Juice
- Water
- Bicarbonate [[Ions]] (to make the pH suitable for the enzymes within)
- [[Enzymes]]
	- Trypsinogen (Inactive form of the trypsin enzyme)
	- Lipase
	- Amylase
