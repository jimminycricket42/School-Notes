The liver is the biggest gland in the body, as well as one of the most complex organs. It has many functions, but we focus on the secretion of bile. 

## The Secretion of Bile
Bile is an alkaline that *emulsifies fats*, physically breaking them down to allow *lipase* to break down lipids into fatty acids and glycerol. It also neutralises the chyme from the stomach, giving the correct pH for the enzymes in [[The Small Intestine]]. 
Bile is produced by the Liver and *stored in the gall bladder* before entering the [[The Small Intestine|small Intestine]] through the *bile duct* ^9543e2
