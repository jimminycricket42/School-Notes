- Glucose conversion during [[Homeostasis#Hormonal Control of Glucose Concentration in the Blood|Homeostatic control of glucose concentration in the blood.]]
- [[Proteins|Amino acid]] breakdown
- Detoxification of the blood
- Vitamin storage for vitamins A, D, E, K, and B<sub>12</sub>
- Heparin synthesis to prevent blood clots

## The Secretion of Bile
Bile is an alkaline that *emulsifies fats*, physically breaking them down to allow *lipase* to break down lipids into fatty acids and glycerol. It also neutralises the chyme from the stomach, giving the correct pH for the enzymes in [[The Small Intestine]]. 
Bile is produced by the Liver and *stored in the gall bladder* before entering the [[The Small Intestine|small Intestine]] through the *bile duct* ^bile
