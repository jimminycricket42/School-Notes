# The Stomach
#GR10/Q2 #the-body/organs/digestive-system #the-body/nutrition 

The stomach is a c-shaped organ with tubes at both ends. It is connected to the [[The Oesophagus]] through the *cardiac sphincter* and is connected to the [[The Small Intestine]] through the *pyloric sphincter*. The stomach is responsible for the formation of *acidic chyme* through the *mechanical digestion of food* and the *chemical digestion of protein* through the [[Enzymes#Types of Enzymes|trypsin enzyme]]. Trypsin requires an acid medium, and the stomach is full of *gastric juice* with a *pH of 2.1*. Gastric Juice consists of: ^c63229
- Water
- Mucous
- Hydrochloric Acid
- [[Enzymes#Types of Enzymes|Pepsin]] (And it’s inactive form: Pepsinogen)

## The Stomach’s Protection from Pepsin
The stomach has a *mucous lining* that protects the stomach wall from any pepsin within the stomach. Additionally, pepsin is originally secreted as *pepsinogen*, which is the inactive form of pepsin, in order to prevent it from destroying the walls of the stomach. Pepsinogen is then activated by the pH in the stomach.
