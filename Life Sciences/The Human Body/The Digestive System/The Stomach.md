# The Stomach
The Stomach is where [[Digestion|mechanical digestion]] occurs. It sits at the end of the [[The Oesophagus|oesophagus]], from which it receives the bolus. It is a c-shaped sac-like organ that connects to the [[The Oesophagus|oesophagus]] through the *cardiac sphincter*. Within the stomach is gastric juice, which chemically digests [[proteins]] using the [[Enzymes|enzyme Trypsin]]. The walls of the stomach mechanically digest food, and this mixture of broken-up food and gastric juice is known as chyme. Once the chyme has been formed, it is sent through the *pyloric sphincter* to the [[The Small Intestine|small intestine]]. ^Blurb

## Mechanical Digestion in the Stomach 
During [[Digestion]], the stomach performs a churning motion that break down food into smaller chunks. This also mixes the food with the *gastric juice*, which aids in digestion. 

The mechanical breakdown in the stomach comes from the repeated contraction and relaxation of the muscles in the walls of the stomach. This is called the churning of the stomach, and it converts the bolus into *chyme*.

The bolus will enter the stomach from the [[The Oesophagus|oesophagus]] through the *cardiac valve* and will leave through the *pylorus valve*, where it will enter the [[The Small Intestine|small intestine]]. 

## The Stomach’s Protection from Pepsin

Pepsin is the [[Enzymes|enzyme]] which digests [[proteins]], and as we know our body is made of proteins. This creates a problem, as pepsin cannot distinguish between the proteins it must digest and the proteins that make up the stomach wall. To prevent this, the stomach uses multiple methods, such as:

To protect itself, the stomach has a *mucous lining* that protects the stomach wall from any pepsin within the stomach. 
Additionally, when secreting pepsin, it is initially secret in it’s inactive form known as pepsinogen. Pepsinogen cannot digest anything until it is activated. The pH of the stomach acid is the trigger for pepsinogen to activate and become pepsin. 

> [!summary]- Summary of the Stomach’s Protection from Pepsin  
> Pepsin is the enzyme which digests protein. To protect the muscles of the body from pepsin, the following happens in the stomach:
> - The stomach secretes a mucous lining to protect itself
> - Pepsin is released inactively as Pepsinogen, which allows it to enter the stomach and then get activated by stomach acid.
