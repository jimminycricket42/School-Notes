# Nutrition in the Human Body
Nutrition is important for the functioning in the human body. It provides the energy for our day-to-day activities, as well as provides material and energy for the growth and repair of the human cells. Additionally, it helps regulate the processes in the human body. 

Nutrition is broken into five separate processes:
- *Ingestion* – the intake of food
- *Digestion* – the breakdown of insoluble [[Monomers#^974fd6|polymers]] into smaller, [[Solubility]] [[Monomers]]
- *Absorption* – soluble [[Monomers]] are absorbed into the [[Lymphatic System]] and [[The Circulatory System]].
- *Assimilation* – absorbed nutrients are used in the body, and this process is known as assimilation
- *Egestion* – unused food residue is expelled by egestion. Solid waste is called faeces and is removed through defecation
- If the nutrient took part in the metabolism, the process of removing the nutrients is *excretion*.

The [[The Abdominal Cavity]] is specialized to allow us to perform all the processes of nutrition. 

## Ingestion
Ingestion occurs in the mouth (proper name: the buccal cavity). The mouth performs *Mechanical* and *Chemical* digestion, as the teeth mechanically break apart food and the mouth secretes Salivary Amylase. This creates a *bolus* of food that is moved down [[The Oesophagus]] through [[Muscles#^Peristalsis|peristalsis]]. 

## Digestion
Digestion takes place in two areas of the body: the [[The Stomach|stomach]] and  [[The Small Intestine]].  

### Digestion in the Stomach
The bolus enters the stomach the *cardia valve* and exits through the *pylorus valve*. The stomach begins to secrete *pepsinogen*, the inactive form of *pepsin*. Pepsin is the enzyme responsible for the digestion of proteins. The stomach also begins to *churn* to break up the bolus and mix it with the *gastric juice* in the stomach. This creates *chyme*. Once the stomach is finished, the chyme is forced through the pyloric sphincter (pylorus valve) into the *small intestine* for further digestion. 
> [!info] Fun Fact:
> Food stays in the stomach for around 4 hours. 

#### The Protection of the Stomach From Pepsin
Pepsin is responsible to break up proteins, and as we know our body is made of proteins. This creates a problem, as we would eat ourselves alive if the pepsin came into contact with out muscle. To prevent this, the stomach uses multiple methods, such as:
- Secreting a mucous membrane known as the stomach lining
- Secreting pepsin as un-activated pepsinogen, so that it may be activated by the gastric juice

#### Contents of Gastric Juice
Gastric Juice consists of:
- water
- mucous
- Hydrochloric acid
- Pepsin (and pepsinogen)
