# The Large Intestine
The colon is the place where *faeces* are stored before [[Egestion]]. 
It is the last tube in the [[The Digestive System|digestive system]] that absorbs nutrients. Here, the final absorption of water and mineral salts takes place. It receives the everything that the [[The Small Intestine|small intestine]] could not digest. Undigested waste is stored in the large intestine before [[Egestion]] through the anus. 

## Parts of the Large Intestine
The large intestine is made up of:
- **The caecum** – the attachment point between the [[The Small Intestine|small intestine]], the [[The Large Intestine]], and *the appendix*.
- **Colon** – the largest part of the large intestine, consisting of the ascending, transverse and descending colon
- **Rectum** – the final section of the colon, ended by the anus.
