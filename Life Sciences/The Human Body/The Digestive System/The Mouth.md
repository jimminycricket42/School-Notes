# The Mouth
#GR10/Q2 #the-body/organs/digestive-system #the-body/nutrition 

The mouth (also called the buccal cavity) is where [[Nutrition in the Human body#Ingestion|ingestion]] occurs. When talking about the mouth, we look at a few key things:
1. The Structure of our Jaw
2. The tongue
3. The Salivary Glands

## The Structure of our Jaw
As we know our mouth contains teeth, which come in different shapes depending on their purpose. This differentiation of shapes classifies humans as *heterodonts*, meaning all our teeth have different structures and functions. We are also *difiodonts*, meaning we only have two sets of teeth in our lifetimes.

> Dolphin’s teeth are all of the same structure and function, classifying them as homodonts
### Types of Teeth
Humans have 4 types of teeth: Molars, Premolars, Canines, and Incisors
#### molars (m)
We have 6 molars on top of our mouth and 6 at the bottom. They are used to grind food. 
#### Premolars (pm)
We have 4 premolars on the top of our mouth and 4 at the bottom. They are used to grind food
#### Canines (c)
We have 2 canines on the top of our mouth and 2 at the bottom. They are used to bite or tear food, or to hold onto it. Predators use canines to kill their prey
#### Incisors
We have 4 incisors on the top of our mouth and 4 at the bottom. They are used to cut and bite food. They are sharp and chisel shaped

#### Representing teeth
we can represent teeth with a simple diagram:
$$\frac{\textrm{2.1.2.3}}{\textrm{2.1.2.3}}$$
the top row represents the top row of teeth from front to back, the bottom row represents the bottom row of teeth front to back. 

## The Tongue
The tongue is a [[Muscles|muscular]] organ that moves food from one side of the mouth to the other, pushes the food between our teeth, mixes the food with saliva, forms the food into a ball known as the *bolus*, facilitates swallowing by pushing food down the [[The Oesophagus|throat]], and can taste 4 different tastes

1. Bitter
2. Sour
3. Salt
4. Sweet

## The Salivary Glands
The Salivary Glands secrete saliva into the mouth. Saliva contains the enzyme *salivary amylase* that digests starch into maltose. 

### Composition of Saliva
Saliva is made up of:
- water – acts as a solvent and a mucous for chemical reactions and a reagent in hydrolysis
- Mucus – binds chewed food to make the bolus easier to swallow
- Bicarbonate [[Ions]] – make saliva slightly alkaline
- Salivary amylase
