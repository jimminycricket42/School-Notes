# The Mouth
The mouth (also called the buccal cavity) is where [[Nutrition in Animals#Ingestion|ingestion]] occurs. It begins the process of mechanical digestion through *mastication*. Masticated food forms a bolus, which is pushed by the tongue into the [[The Oesophagus|oesophagus]]. ^blurb

## Mechanical Digestion in the Mouth
The mouth contains the teeth and the tongue, both of which play a large role in the mechanical digestion of food. 

The teeth perform *mastication*, or chewing, which is the first place where food is ground into smaller particles. 

The tongue mixes the chewed food with saliva and forms it into a bolus. The bolus is then pushed by the tongue into the [[The Oesophagus|oesophagus]]. before it enters the [[The Stomach|stomach]].

## Parts of the Mouth
When talking about the mouth, we look at a few key things:
- [[#The Structure of our Jaw]]
- [[#The Tongue]]
- [[#The Salivary Glands]]

### The Structure of our Jaw
As we know our mouth contains teeth, which come in different shapes depending on their purpose. This differentiation of shapes classifies humans as *heterodonts*, meaning all our teeth have different structures and functions. We are also *difiodonts*, meaning we only have two sets of teeth in our lifetimes.

> [!info] Fun Fact
> Dolphin’s teeth are all of the same structure and function, classifying them as homodonts

#### Types of Teeth
Humans have 4 types of teeth: 
- **Molars (m)** – We have 6 molars on top of our mouth and 6 at the bottom. They are used to grind food. 
- **Premolars (pm)** – We have 4 premolars on the top of our mouth and 4 at the bottom. They are used to grind food
- **Canines (c)** – We have 2 canines on the top of our mouth and 2 at the bottom. They are used to bite or tear food, or to hold onto it. Predators use canines to kill their prey
- **Incisors (i)** – We have 4 incisors on the top of our mouth and 4 at the bottom. They are used to cut and bite food. They are sharp and chisel shaped

We can represent teeth with a simple diagram:

$$\frac{\textrm{2.1.2.3}}{\textrm{2.1.2.3}}$$

the top row represents the top row of teeth from front to back, the bottom row represents the bottom row of teeth front to back. 


### The Tongue
The tongue is a [[Muscles|muscular]] organ that moves food from one side of the mouth to the other, pushes the food between our teeth, mixes the food with saliva, forms the food into a ball known as the *bolus*, facilitates swallowing by pushing food down the [[The Oesophagus|throat]].

>> 4: Sweet

To swallow, the tongue pushes against the palate at the top of the mouth cavity. The palate is made of two parts – the *hard palate* and the *soft palate*. The soft palate ends in the *uvula* which *closes the anterior opening of the nasal cavity* when swallowing, preventing food and water from going into the nasal cavity. 

### The Salivary Glands
The Salivary Glands secrete saliva into the mouth. They are a type of [[exocrine glands]] Saliva contains the enzyme *salivary amylase* that digests starch into maltose. 

Saliva is made up of:
- **Water** – acts as a solvent chemical reactions and a reagent in hydrolysis
- **Mucus** – binds chewed food to make the bolus easier to swallow
- **Bicarbonate Electrons** – make saliva slightly alkaline
- **Salivary amylase** – an [[enzyme]] which digests carbohydrates

There are three salivary glands:
- The **parotid salivary glands** – Located below the ears
- The **submandibular salivary glands** – Located in the lower jaw
- The **sublingual salivary glands** – Located in underneath the tongue.
