# The pharynx
The pharynx (or throat) lays between the [[The Mouth|mouth]] and the [[The Oesophagus|oesophagus]]. Here, food and air passes through. There is a small cartilaginous valve on one side that leads to [[The Trachea]]. This valve is called the epiglottis, and it prevents us from choking under normal circumstances.   ^blurb
