# The Lungs
Lungs are spongy, reddish organs that are enclosed by the pleura. There are two lungs, the left and the right, and they both differ in structure slightly. The *left lung* has two [[The Bronchi|bronchioli]] lobes, and is slightly longer and thinner. The *right lung* is slightly shorter and wider, and has three [[The Bronchi|bronchioli]] lobes. Below the lungs is the *diaphragm*, which is a muscular plate that separates the [[The Digestive System|abdominal cavity]] from the [[The Thoracic Cavity|thoracic cavity]]. The [[The Bronchi|alveolar tubes]] in a group of lung sacks, the [[Alveoli]].

## The Blood circulation of the Lungs
The lungs are responsible for oxygenating [[Blood]]. They receive *deoxygenated blood* from the *left ventricle of [[The Structure of the Heart|the heart]]* via the *pulmonary artery*. The pulmonary artery separates into capillary networks that surround the alveoli. They then reunite into veins filled with oxygenated blood
