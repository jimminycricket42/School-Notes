# The Nose
## Structure of the Nose
![[Nasal Cavity.png]]

## The nose in Gaseous Exchange
Air enter the [[Lungs]] through the [[The Nose|nose]], which filters, moistens, and warms the air to be more suitable for the body. Bony ridges in the nasal cavity then direct the flow of air towards the [[The Trachea|trachea]]. 

## Functions
- entrance for air to the lungs
- moistens air
- warms air to body temp
- filters dust and bacteria with [[cilia]]
- Allows us to smell through the olfactory region

## The olfactory region
The olfactory region is situated in the upper region of the nasal cavity. It contains hair that can sense chemical stimuli. Aromatic substances dissolve in the moisture of this area and are detected by the hair and transmitted by [[Neurons (Nervous Tissue)#Sensory Neuron|sensory neurons]] to the olfactory region of the brain where smell is interpreted.
