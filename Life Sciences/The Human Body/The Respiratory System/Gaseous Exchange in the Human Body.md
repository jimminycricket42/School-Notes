# Gaseous Exchange in the Human Body
The system of gaseous exchange in mammals consists of:
- [[Lungs]] that provide a large system for gaseous exchange
- A *system of tubes*  though which air moves to the lungs and back 
- The [[Breathing]] muscles that bring about ventilation. 

## Pathway of air to the lungs
Air enter the [[Lungs]] through the [[The Nose|nose]], which filters, moistens, and warms the air to be more suitable for the body. Bony ridges in the nasal cavity then direct the flow of air towards the Pharynx, which takes the air down closer to the lungs and eventually into the [[The Trachea|trachea]]. Here, it passes the [[The Oesophagus|epiglottis]] which prevents food from going into your lungs. The trachea separates into the [[The Bronchi|bronchi]], which further separate into the [[Alveoli|alveolar tubes]] that feed into [[Alveoli|infundibulum]] and [[Alveoli]], where [[Gaseous Exchange]] occurs. The process of air moving from your nose to your lungs and back is called [[Breathing]]

### Proportions of Gases in the blood
#### Carbon Dioxide
5% of CO<sub>2</sub> is found in the blood plasma
30% is found in the Haemoglobin as carbamino-haemoglobin
65% is found as Bicarbonate ions when bonded to water in the blood. This process is called carbonic anhydrase

#### Oxygen
1.5% of oxygen is transported in solution in the blood plasma
98,5% of Oxygen diffuses into the haemoglobin
