# Gaseous Exchange
**Definition**: the physical process by which gases move passively by [[Diffusion]] across a surface. 

Humans use gaseous exchange to receive oxygen for [[Cellular Respiration|cellular respiration]] and to remove the waste product *carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)*. However, this process requires a *specialised surface in the [[Lungs]]*. 

And effective surface for gaseous exchange consists of the following characteristics:
- *Large surface* to absorb enough oxygen.
- *This surface* for easy diffusion.
- *Moist* to facilitate diffusion and for the well being of the surface itself.
- A *transport system*  eg. the blood that carries oxygen to the cells and carbon dioxide away from the cells.
- A *ventilation system* to bring the source of oxygen into contact with the gaseous exchange surface.
- Sufficient *protection* from desiccation (drying out) and mechanical injury.
