# The Bronchi
The [[The Trachea|trachea]] separates into the left and right bronchi which lead to the left and right lungs. They are kept open by O-shaped cartilage rings (opposed to the [[The Trachea|trachea]]â€˜s C-shaped rings). The bronchus lead to the lungs, where they separate into the bronchioli. There are three bronchioli in the right lung and two in the left lung. The bronchioli separate further into alveolar tubes that lead to the [[Alveoli]].
