# The Alveoli
The alveoli are found in [[Lungs]] at the end of *alveolar tubes* that come from the [[The Bronchi|bronchi]] and the [[The Trachea|trachea]]. A group of alveoli are called an *infundibulum*. The alveoli are where [[Gaseous Exchange]] occurs in the human body. They have a single layer of [[Epithelium|squamous epithelium]] that forms a surface for gaseous exchange. There is a network of blood vessels around the infundibulum which brings each alveoli into contact with transport medium for gases [[Blood]]. 

## Gaseous Exchange in the Alveoli

### Proportions of Gases in the blood
#### Carbon Dioxide
5% of CO<sub>2</sub> is found in the blood plasma
30% is found in the Haemoglobin as carbamino-haemoglobin
65% is found as Bicarbonate ions when bonded to water in the blood. This process is called carbonic anhydrase

#### Oxygen
1.5% of oxygen is transported in solution in the blood plasma
98,5% of Oxygen diffuses into the haemoglobin
