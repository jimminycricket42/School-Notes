# The Trachea
The trachea starts with a wide opening known as the larynx, with the vocal cords right below in a *cartilaginous voice box*. The larynx connects to the [[The Oesophagus|oesophagus]], but there is a valve – the epiglottis – which prevents food from going into the trachea. The trachea is lined with a mucous membrane that contains ciliated [[Epithelium]], and is held open by a c-shaped cartilage rings. The cilia keep mucous out of the [[Lungs]]. They use wave-like movements to work as a conveyer belt for the mucous. The trachea splits into the left and bright bronchi. This means that the trachea is essential for [[Breathing]] and [[Gaseous Exchange in the Human Body]]
