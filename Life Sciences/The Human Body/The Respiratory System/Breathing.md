# Breathing
**Definition**: Mechanical process that brings source of *oxygen*  (air) into contact with the surface for [[Gaseous Exchange]]

## The Breathing Process
The breathing process uses the *diaphragm* and the *external intercostal muscles* to breathe. 
During inhalation, these muscles contract, making inhalation an *active process*. 
*exhalation* is a passive process that occurs when the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax. However, there is *active exhalation*. In this case, the abdominal and internal intercostal muscles contact to force air out of the lungs. 

### Inhalation
Air is sucked into the lungs when the pressure in the lungs is lower than the air pressure outside the body. This can be achieved by:
- The external intercostals contract and expand the ribcage up and out
- Contracting the diaphragm, making it flatter
- These two cause the thoracic cavity to expand, decreasing pressure, and sucking air into the lungs via the  air passages ([[The Trachea|trachea]], [[The Bronchi|bronchi]])

### Exhalation
Exhalation occurs when the pressure in the thoracic decreases. 
- External intercostals and diaphragm relax
- Ribcage returns to the original size
- Pressure is exerted on the lungs
- Air is forced out of the air passages

#### Forced Exhalation
The abdominal muscles contract and push up against the diaphragm. The internal intercostal muscles also contract, causing a rapid decrease in pressure and forcing air out of the lungs. 

## The Control of Breathing by the brain (Homeostatic Control of Breathing)
The *medulla oblongata* near the base of the brain is where breathing rate is determined. It connects to chemoreceptors that detect the decrease in pH of the blood. The blood’s pH decreases when the cells perform [[Cellular Respiration|cellular respiration]] and give off the waste product of CO<sub>2</sub>, which dissolves in water to form *carbonic acid*. The change in pH causes the medulla oblongata to make [[The Structure of the Heart|the heart]] beat beat faster and the lungs to breathe more. 

Example:
You have been running, using energy and your muscles.
- Your muscles use more energy, meaning they need to respire more and create more waste products
- This waste product (CO<sub>2</sub>) is absorbed by the water blood and transported in the veins as carbonic acid
- In the veins there are chemoreceptors that detect the decrease in pH caused by the presence of carbonic acid. 
- These signals are sent through [[Neurons (Nervous Tissue)|sensory neurons]] to the medulla oblongata
- The medulla oblongata sends a signal to your [[The Structure of the Heart|heart]] and lungs to increase in tempo of pumping and breathing respectively
- The increase in tempo causes more deoxygenated blood to reach the lungs, and more oxygenated blood to leave the lungs
- When you calm down and stop exercising, your cells return to their regular energy usage and the pH of your blood returns, meaning your lungs and [[The Structure of the Heart|heart]] can also return to the regular rate of breathing.

- Inspiratory Reserve volume – The amount of air that can be taken in and out of the lungs in a single respiratory cycle
- Inspiratory Capacity – The total amount of air that can voluntarily be inhaled
- Expiratory Reserve volume – the amount of air that can be expelled over and above the tidal volume
- Expiratory capacity – The total amount of air that can be exhaled
- Tidal Volume – the amount of air exchanged between a single breath
- Residual Volume – The amount of air that remains in the lungs
