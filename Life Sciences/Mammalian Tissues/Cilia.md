# Cilia
Cilia are small hair-like structures that form on some [[Epithelium#Cuboidal Epithelium|cuboidal epithelium]] and [[Epithelium#Columnar epithelium|columnar epithelium]]. Cilia prevent debris and pathogens from invading the body, and they help with the movement of water and other materials in the body. ^blurb
