# Muscles
Muscles are responsible for all movement in the human body. 

There are two groups of Muscles, categorised by [[Neurons (Nervous Tissue)#Location of the Nervous System|which nerves control them]]: 
- *Voluntary muscles* require conscious decision to move, and is controlled by the Central Nervous System. 
- *Involuntary muscles* are controlled subconsciously by the Autonomic Nervous System. 

Our muscles *move according to impulses received from [[Neurons (Nervous Tissue)]]*. Neurons send impulses to groups of *muscle fibres*, which in turn contract and create movement. *Muscles can only ever contract* — they do not expand. When a *muscle is contracted, it is short and thick*, when a *muscle is extended, it is long and thin*. 

Muscle fibres work according to an all-or-nothing principal, meaning they contract fully or not at all. Therefore, the muscle isn't stimulated by a single impulse, but rather continuous, fast impulses from [[Neurons (Nervous Tissue)]]

## Functions of Muscles
Muscles perform various functions within the body, such as *movement* and functions linked to movement, such as the beating of [[The Structure of the Heart|the heart]] and pumping of blood. Additionally, *muscles produce body heat*.
