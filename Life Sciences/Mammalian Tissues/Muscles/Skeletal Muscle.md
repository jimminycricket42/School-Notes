# Skeletal Muscle
Skeletal [[Muscles]] are voluntary muscles controlled by [[Neurons (Nervous Tissue)|motor neurons]]. They are found in the arms, legs, torso, and throughout the body. Skeletal muscle is what we use to move, and it connects to the [[Bones]] through [[Dense Connective Tissue#White Fibrous Connective Tissues (Tendons)|tendons]]. 

## Structure of Skeletal Muscle
Skeletal Muscles are made up of long, cylindrical fibres bound by sheaths called the *sarcolemma*. These muscle fibres can have several nuclei, making then *multinucleate*. Groups of these fibres is then surrounded by the *fasciculus* within the *endomysium*.

[[Blood|Blood Vessels]] are found in the connective tissue surrounding larger muscles, as well in the muscles themselves.

Skeletal muscles are made up of multiple muscular bundles within an *endomysium* that are padded by the *perimysium*. Within the perimysium there are bundles of *myofibres* within protective sheaths known as *fasciculus*. The fasciculus contains the endomysium, which in turn protects the myofibres. Myofibres are surrounded by a sarcolema and contain myofibrils within the sarcoplasma.

## Control of Skeletal Muscles
Skeletal Muscles are voluntary muscles, meaning they receive impulses from the central nervous system. These impulses travel along [[Neurons (Nervous Tissue)#Motor Neurons|motor neurons]] to a group of muscles fibres. One motor neuron can control a number of muscle fibres, promoting the coordinated movement of a muscle. 

### Antagonistic Muscles
Antagonistic muscles help us further coordinate movements. All muscles are found in pairs, with one agonistic muscle and one antagonistic muscle. One muscle *relaxes* while the other *contracts*. This allows fine movement, as we can better control our range of movement
