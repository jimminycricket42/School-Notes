# Smooth Muscle (Visceral Muscle)
Smooth [[Muscles]] are involuntary muscles controlled by the *autonomic nervous system*. They are found in organs, such as [[The Small Intestine|the small intestine]], blood vessels, and the diaphragm. ^blurb

 Smooth muscles are sensitive to the contractions of other adjacent cells, which causes wave like contractions in organs like the digestive tract. This kind of movement is called *[[Muscles#^Peristalsis|peristalsis]]*. The contractions of smooth muscle is *slow and rhythmic*. 

## Structure of Smooth Muscle
Smooth muscle fibres are made of small, spindle-shaped cells with single, oval nuclei that are bound together by [[Connective Tissues]].
