# Cardiac Muscle
Cardiac muscle tissue is only found in [[The Structure of the Heart|the heart]], and it's structure is so unique that it requires to be a separate category to [[Skeletal Muscle]] and [[Smooth Muscle]]. ^blurb

Cardiac Muscle has a unique property called *automatism*.  It has it's own pacemaker that can keep [[The Structure of the Heart|the heart]] beating rhythmically *without input from the nervous system*.

## Structure of Cardiac Muscle
Cardiac muscles are made of branched cells that connect via intercalated discs. These cells have a single round nucleus, and can branch off or merge into separate cells.
