# Epithelium
Epithelium are *tightly packed cells* with very *little intercellular space*. All epithelium exist with a membrane beneath them, known as a *basement membrane*, that supports the cells. ^blurb

They can occur as a single layer, known as simple epithelium, or they can occur in multiple layers, known as compound or stratified epithelium.

## Function:
- Allows [[Diffusion]]
- Makes internal surfaces smooth
- Reduces [[Electrostatics|friction]]

## Types of Epithelium:
- [[Epithelium#Squamous Epithelium]]
- [[Epithelium#Cuboidal Epithelium]]
- [[Epithelium#Columnar epithelium]]
- [[Epithelium#Glandular Epithelium]]

## Cilia and Microvilli
![[Cilia]]
![[Microvilli]]

## Squamous Epithelium
Squamous epithelium are a *single layer of large, flat cells* that join together in a mosaic pattern. They have a *single, flat nucleus* and are less that *2Î¼m thin*. They are permeable, and play a role in [[Diffusion]].

### Location:
- Walls of the infundibula (surrounds the alveolus in the lungs, and is found in women around in the fallopian tubes)
- Lining of blood vessels
- Lining of the mouth
- Oesophagus (the tube from the mouth to the stomach)

## Cuboidal Epithelium
Cuboidal epithelium are *cube shaped cells* that are closely packed together. The height and the width of the sides is even, giving it its name: cuboidal epithelium.

[[Microvilli]] and [[Cilia]] can be found on Cuboidal Epithelium, but not commonly. They are far more likely to be found on more specialized [[#Columnar epithelium]].

### Location:
- Found in most glands where substances are secreted
- Renal Tubules (in the liver)
   
## Columnar epithelium
Column shaped and *elongated from the base*. Some have [[microvilli]] or [[cilia]]. Columnar epithelium *make up the mucous membranes* of many organs. 

[[microvilli]] and [[cilia]] can be found on Epithelium, but not commonly. The [[cilia]] are hair-like structures meant to trap foreign particles. [[Microvilli]] increase the surface area for secretion.

### Location:
- Lining of the stomach
- small intestine.
- Urethra
- Sperm duct and part of the uterus

## Glandular Epithelium
Can be made up of [[#Columnar epithelium]] or [[#Cuboidal Epithelium]], and any of those epithelium that contain *goblet cells* are considered to be glandular epithelium. The Glandular epithelium secrete substances such as wax, milk, mucus, hormones or enzymes.

- Prostate
- Ear 
- Mammary glands
