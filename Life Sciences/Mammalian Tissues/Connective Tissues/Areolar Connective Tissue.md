# Areolar Connective Tissue
The Areolar tissue consists of a *jelly-like matrix* with other cells suspended within it. It *forms a continuous layer beneath the skin* that *binds the skin loosely to the underlying [[muscles]]*. It  also *binds organs together*, and surrounds them with adipose cells (fat cells). This acts as a shock absorber for the organs.  ^blurb

## Function:
- "packing material" for sensitive organs
- Fat storage
- Creates an insulator to prevent heat loss.

## Location:
- Under the skin
- Between organs

| Cell                  | Function                               |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| White Melastic Fibres | Provides Tensile Strength              |
| Yellow Elastic Fibres | Provides Elasticity                    |
| Macrophages           | Helps with the bodies immunity         |
| Fibroblasts           | Secretes the White and Yellow Fibres   |
| Mast Cells            | Secretes the Matrix (Ground Substance) |
| Adipose               | Stores fat                             |

> *note:* the Matrix, the White Melastic Fibres, and the Yellow Melastic fibres are all considered non-living.
