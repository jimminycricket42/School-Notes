# Connective Tissues
# Connective Tissues

Connective tissues have larger intercellular spaces, with a lot of substances between the cells. This space contains a ground 
substance, also known as the matrix. 

## Connective tissues are made up of:
- [[Areolar Connective Tissue]] - binding tissue
- [[Dense Connective Tissue]] - ligaments, tendons,
- [[Cartilage]]
- [[Blood]]
- [[Bones]]

# Cells within Connective Tissue
| Cell                                  | Function                               |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| White Melastic Fibres/Collagen Fibres | Provides Tensile Strength              |
| Yellow Elastic Fibres                 | Provides Elasticity                    |
| Macrophages                           | Helps with the bodies immunity         |
| Fibroblasts                           | Secretes the White and Yellow Fibres   |
| Mast Cells                            | Secretes the Matrix (Ground Substance) |
| Adipose                               | Stores fat                             |
