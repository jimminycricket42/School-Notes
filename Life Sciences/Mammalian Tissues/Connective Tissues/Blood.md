# Blood
Blood is a *circulatory tissue* that contains *plasma* with cells suspended in it. This plasma is non-living, and forms the matrix of blood. Blood can be broken into Erythrocytes and Leukocytes (commonly known as red and white blood cells), as well as Thrombocytes (known as platelets).

## Plasma
The plasma contains cells, water, dissolved substances, colloids, and particles in suspension. The plasma is responsible for transporting these substances around the body. It also helps keep the body's temperature constant. 
### Inorganic Substances
- Water — forms a solvent for [[Electrons]] and a transport medium for other particles
- Salts — NaCl and others
- Gases — dissolved Carbon Dioxide and Oxygen
### Organic Substances
- Proteins — Albumin, Globulin, and Fibrinogen
- Glucose and Fats
- Hormones and Enzymes
- Waste products: — urea and other substances from the protein metabolism

## Erythrocytes (Red Blood Cells, Red Blood Corpuscles)
Erythrocytes are *responsible for transporting oxygen*. They *have no nucleus*, giving them a *bi-concave shape* (having a dent in the centre). This classifies them as corpuscles instead of cells. It also *allows them to transport more Oxygen and Carbon dioxide* to the capillaries. The Oxygen in them reacts with the Haemoglobin, which contains iron, giving them their red colour. 

The nucleus disintegrates after the cell is formed in the [[Bones#Functions|bone marrow]] to make space for other cells. 

There are around 5 red blood cells per ml of blood, and they are around 7μm wide. They circulate for around 120 days before breaking down.

## Leukocytes (White Blood Cells)
Leukocytes *form our immune systems*, protecting us from infections and allergies. They are larger than red blood cells, and they are formed in the [[Bones]]. They *do not have a fixed shape*, as they must perform *[Phagocytosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocytosis)* (the ingestion and elimination of particles) to protect our body from foreign agents. 

The body *produces Leukocytes as a reaction to sickness or injury*, meaning that the amount of leukocytes in the body varies, but on average there are around 8000 cells per millilitre of blood. 

### The Nuclei of Leukocytes
There are 5 different types of white blood cells, that are defined by the structure of their Nucleus. There are *Neutrophils*, *Eosinophils*, and *Basophils* that are all considered *granular* white blood corpuscles with *polymorphic Nuclei*. There are also *Monocytes* and *Lymphocytes*, which are considered as *agranular* white blood corpuscles. *Monocytes have kidney-bean shaped nuclei*, and *Lymphocytes have large oval nuclei*.

## Thrombocytes (Blood Platelets)
The Thrombocytes are small discs that have no nuclei. They help the blood clot around cuts by using fibrinogen. They only last around 4 days before they self-destruct.
