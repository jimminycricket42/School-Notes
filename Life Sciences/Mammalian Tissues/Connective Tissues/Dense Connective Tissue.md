# Dense Connective Tissue   
Dense connective tissues are *used for connections in the body*. We study *Tendons and Ligaments*, which *connect muscle to [[Bones]]* and *[[Bones]] to [[Bones]]* respectively. 

They are both made up of *fibres* that are secreted by *[[Connective Tissues#Cells within Connective Tissue|fibroblasts]]*, but *Tendons are made of white, inelastic collagen fibres* and *Ligaments are made of yellow, elastic fibres*.

> A *sprain* is a torn ligament, and is less severe.
> A *strain* is a torn [[Muscles|muscle]] or tendon and is more severe..

Dense connective tissues form the *[[Skeletal Muscle|Fibrous Sheaths]] of [[Muscles]]*. They also form the sheath around [[Bones]], known as the *[[Bones|periosteum]]*, and the sheath around [[Cartilage]], known as the *[[Cartilage|perichondrium]]*

## White Fibrous Connective Tissues (Tendons)
Tendons are made of densely packed *collagen fibres*, and they connect *muscle to [[Bones]] or muscle*. These collagen fibres are *thick and white* and give the tendon great *tensile strength*. You will find *parallel 'bundles' of fibres interspersed with rows of [[Connective Tissues#Cells within Connective Tissue|fibroblasts]].* ^tendon

## Yellow Elastic Connective Tissues (Ligaments)
Ligaments are made of *thin, yellow elastic fibres*. They connect *[[Bones]] to [[Bones]]*, and allow for *flexibility at the joints*. There are [[Connective Tissues#Cells within Connective Tissue|fibroblasts]] scattered between the ligaments. ^ligament
