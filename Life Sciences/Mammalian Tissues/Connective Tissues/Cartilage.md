# Cartilage
Cartilage is an elastic tissue that forms part of [[Structure of the Skeletal System|The Skeleton]].  It makes up many of the softer parts of the body, and surrounds the [[Bones|bones]].  ^blurb

## General Structure of Cartilage 
Cartilage is made up of *semi-transparent and tough elastic tissue*. The matrix of all cartilage is made up of a protein called *chondrin*. *Chondroblasts* are found in water-filled-hollows called *Lacunae*, and they *form and repair the cartilage*. Cartilage is surrounded by the *perichondrium*, which protects it from harm through force, or [[Electrostatics|friction]] between [[Bones]].

> There are no [[blood vessels]] within cartilage â€” nutrients are transferred by means of [[Diffusion]].

There are three types of cartilage: 
- [[#Hyaline cartilage]]
- [[#Elastic Cartilage]]
- [[#Fibrous Cartilage / Fibrocartilage]]

## Hyaline Cartilage
Hyaline Cartilage consists of a jelly-like, but firm substance. It has a clear, almost glassy appearance. *It contains no fibres*, unlike elastic- and fibrous- cartilage

Hyaline cartilage surrounds joints, acting as a form of *protection from [[Electrostatics|friction]]*.

## Elastic Cartilage
Elastic cartilage consists of the matrix, with the chondroblasts in the Lacunae, but it also has *[[Connective Tissues#Cells within Connective Tissue|yellow elastic fibres]]* interspersed in the cell. 

Elastic Cartilage *makes up the nose and outer ear*.

## Fibrous Cartilage / Fibrocartilage
Fibrous Cartilage consists of cells in a matrix with *[[Connective Tissues#Cells within Connective Tissue|collagen fibres]]*. This makes it an intermediate form between cartilage and [[Dense Connective Tissue]].

Fibrous Cartilage *protects the tendons* where they have to slide over bones, and *forms the discs between vertebrae*.
