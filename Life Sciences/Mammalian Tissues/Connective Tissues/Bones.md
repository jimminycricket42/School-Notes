# Bones
Bones are responsible for *giving an organism its shape*, as well as *protecting vital organs* . Furthermore, *they act as the attachment point for [[Muscles]]*, which allows us to use them as levers to move. ^blurb

## General Structure
Bones have a similar structure to [[Cartilage]], they have cells suspended in liquid-filled *Lacunae* that secrete a matrix. The cells within the lacunae are called *osteoblasts* and the matrix they secrete is filled with *calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate*. This makes the matrix very hard. Bones are sheathed in the periosteum, which is made of [[Dense Connective Tissue]]. 

### Haversian Systems
Bones are made up of *Haversian Systems*, which are concentric rings surrounding a *Haversian Canal*. Every one of these rings is called a *Lamella*, and the lacunae are found along the lamella. They are connected by *Canali Culi* which transfers [[Blood]] from the haversian canal to the cells in the lamellae. Together, all of these components form *compact bones*

## Functions
Bones *give an organism shape*, and it *protects delicate organs* such as the lungs and the brain. Bones serve as the *point of attachment for [[Muscles]]*, and *act as levers* to create movement.
They also contain *red bone marrow*, which is responsible for producing [[Blood|red and white blood corpuscles]]. *Bones also contain yellow marrow*, which stores fat.  

- Give an organism shape
- Protects delicate organs
- Serve as levers and attachment points for [[Muscles]]
- Contain red bone marrow, responsible for producing [[Blood#Erythrocytes Red Blood Cells Red Blood Corpuscles|red blood cells]] and [[Blood#Leukocytes White Blood Cells White Blood Corpuscles|white blood cells]]. 
- Contain yellow bone marrow, responsible for storing fats

## Types of Bones
We look at 4 different types of bones:
- **Long bones** – longer than they are wide
	- :bulb:  Eg. Femur, humerus, ulna
- **Short bones** – wider than they are long
	- :bulb: Eg. Tarsals, phalanges
- **Flat bones** – flat, without other defining traits
	- :bulb: Eg. Skull
- **Irregular bones** – do not fit into other categories
	- :bulb: Eg.  Pelvis, Vertebra
