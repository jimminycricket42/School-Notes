# Neurons (Nervous Tissue)
Neurons are *highly specialised cells* with *various outgrowths* that *conduct electrical impulses* to and from our brains. ^blurb

We have three types of neurons when *classified by function*: 
- [[#Motor Neurons]]
- [[#Sensory Neurons]]
- Interneurons

## Structure of neurons
We can  *classify by structure*
- Monopolar/Unipolar neurons – have only one outgrowth
- Bipolar/Multipolar neurons – have many outgrowths

### Parts of a Nerve Cell
#### Schwann cells
A flat cell that wraps around the axon with multiple layers.
#### Myelin sheath
The myelin sheath is a complex structure because it is made up of many concentric layers of a plasma membrane.
#### Dendrites
Dendrites are the information carrying sections of a neuron. 

## Transfer of signals in the body
In all neurons, there are *dendrites* that receive an impulse and relay it to the *cell body*. The *axon* will then transfer the impulse away from the cell body to the *synaptic endings*. It's important to note: Neurons do not touch. They are connected through *synapses* which convert *electrical impulses to chemical impulses* and back again. 

In your body, a *receptor cell* detects a stimulus and sends this to the brain using the *sensory neurons*. The brain then processes this information and sends out an appropriate response using the *motor neurons* to an *effector gland/organ*. 

## Location of the Nervous System
The core of the nervous system is known as the *central nervous system*. It is located in the brain and around the spinal column. All neurons outside the central nervous system are found with the *peripheral nervous system*.

> [!note]+ :spiral_notepad: Autonomous Nervous System
> 
> In the base of the skull is the medulla oblongata, which controls the autonomous nervous system. The autonomous nervous system is responsible for [[The Structure of the Heart|The Heart]], [[Lungs|the lungs]], and the [[The Digestive System]], as well as some other functions within the body. 

## Functional Differences between Types of Neurons
### Motor Neurons
Motor neurons take impulses *away from the brain, to the body*. They are made of Multipolar Neurons, and are responsible for actions of the body, such as muscle movement or glands. 
Motor neurons send impulses to effectors, which are things that affect the body such as muscles or glands

### Sensory Neuron
Sensory Neurons take impulses *to the brain, away from the body*. They are made of Unipolar Neurons, and are responsible for our bodies ability to receive stimulus. 
Sensory neurons transfer from receivers, which are cells that detect a change in their environment.

### Inter-neurons
Interneurons transmit impulses from the central nervous system to the motor neurons and receives inputs from the sensory neurons. 

## Drugs Effects on the Neuron
There are two ways that drugs can affect the nervous system: They can increase the speed of signals in synapses or they can decrease the speed of signals in the synapses. This leads to two classifications of drugs: "uppers" and "downers".
