# Endoplasmic Reticulum
The endoplasmic Reticulum is a system of membranes within the cell that surrounds the nucleus. We look at two types of Endoplasmic Reticulum, smooth ER and rough ER.

## Functions
- Brings the cell contents into contact with the outside environment
- Enlarges the *internal surface* of the cell
- Acts as an internal transport system for the cell
- Serves as a place for [[Ribosomes]] to connect to

## Smooth ER vs Rough ER 
The two types of ER are convertible. 
### Smooth ER
Smooth, without ribosomes. Produces steroids in some cells, and stores calcium in muscle cells. In the liver, it aids in the metabolism of [[Lipids]]. 
### Rough ER
Granular, with ribosomes on the surface, allowing it to play a role in protein synthesis
