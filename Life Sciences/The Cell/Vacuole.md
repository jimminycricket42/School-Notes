# Vacuole
The vacuole is a fluid-filled cavity in a plant cell that is meant to apply [[Cell Wall#Turgor Pressure|Turgor Pressure]] to the [[Cell Wall]]. It is surrounded by a membrane named a *tonoplast* and is filled with *cell sap*. 

## Functions of the Vacuole
- Provide turgor pressure
- Store dissolved substances (such as sugar and salts)
- Promote [[osmosis]] by creating a low [[Water Potential (Î¨)]]in the cell

## Turgor Pressure
Turgor pressure is the pressure exerted by the organelles against the cell wall. In plant cells, this is mainly created by the [[Vacuole]] filling with water and pressing against the edges of the cell, creating an inward pressure through [[Newtons Third Law]] that gives the cell wall strength. 

If a vacuole if filled with water, it is turgid. When it loses water it becomes flaccid.
