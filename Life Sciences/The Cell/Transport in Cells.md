# Transport in the cells
#gr10/Q1 #biochemistry/transport-in-cells 

There are two types of transport in the body: *intercellular transport* and *intracellular transport*. 

Intercellular transport deals with transport between different cells, and often will use [[Osmosis]] as the method of movement. [[Osmosis|Osmosis]] is an *active transport*, meaning it *requires an input of energy* to move against the [[Diffusion|diffusion]] gradient

Intracellular transport deals with the movement of substances within the cell, and it relies on the [[Diffusion]] of solutes. [[Diffusion|Diffusion]] is a passive process.
