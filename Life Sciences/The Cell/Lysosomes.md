# Lysosomes
Lysosomes are round cells that are involved in *intercellular digestion*. They are made of [[Enzymes]] that are made in [[Ribosomes]] along the [[Endoplasmic Reticulum]], where it is then packaged in the [[Golgi Apparatus]] into lysosomes. They are dispersed around the cytoplasm, where they break down old or damaged organelles and foreign particles. 

They break apart organelles by fusing with them and releasing their enzymes which then degrade the unwanted organelle. When a cell dies, the lysosomes release their enzymes into the cytoplasm, causing the cell to self-destruct
