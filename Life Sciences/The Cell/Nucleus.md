# Nucleus
The nucleus is the most important organelle of the cell. It is the largest *cellular structure* in [[the cell]]. All cells have nuclei (or had a nuclei, in the case of [[Blood#Erythrocytes Red Blood Cells Red Blood Corpuscles|red blood cells]]). 

The nuclei has a double membrane called the *nuclear membrane* that is also *differentially permeable*, like the [[Cell Membrane]]. The outer layer of the double membrane connects to the [[Endoplasmic Reticulum]]. 

The nucleus is filled with the *nuclear plasma* which holds the *chromatin network*, which is responsible for the storage of hereditary information and is essential for [[Mitosis]]. The *nucleolus* is also found in the nuclear plasma, and it consists mainly of RNA and it likely plays a role in protein synthesis.

## Functions of the Nucleus
- Control the cellâ€™s metabolism
- [[Differentiation]] and specialisation of cells
- Transfer of hereditary information to daughter cells during [[mitosis]]
- Reproduction of cells (and organisms) through [[Mitosis]]
