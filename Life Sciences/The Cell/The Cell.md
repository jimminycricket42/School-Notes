# The Cell
A cell is a type of *protoplasm*. Protoplasm consists of all living matter, and a cell is the smallest measure of protoplasm that exhibits the [[Characteristics of Life]]. A cell consists of many parts, but we broadly classify them into *the [[nucleus]]* and *the cytoplasm*. The cytoplasm is all the organelles other than the nucleus, which is enclosed in the [[Cell Membrane]] and suspended in the Groundplasm. ^blurb

## Chemical Components of the Protoplasm
### Inorganic Components
- Water – water acts as a solvent and can make up to 90% of an organism. It is the main component of the protoplasm
- Gases – oxygen and carbon dioxide are dissolved in the protoplasm
- Mineral Salts

### Organic Components
- [[Proteins]] – an important structural components of cell me[[Enzymes|mbranes]] and [[enzymes]]
- [[Carbohydrates]] – Sugars and starch, our most important sources of energy
- [[Lipids]] – Parts of cell membranes and stored as reserve energy
- Nucleic acids – DNA and RNA

## Physical Properties of the Protoplasm
- The protoplasm is a [[Homogeneous Solution|True Solution]] 
- Within the protoplasm there is a [[Classification of Matter|Suspension]] of the cell organelles
- [[Emulsion]]
- [[Colloidal Solutions]] – [[proteins]]

## Organelles
We study the following organelles in organisms:
- [[Cell Membrane]]
- [[Mitochondria]]
- [[Endoplasmic Reticulum]]
- [[Ribosomes]]
- [[Golgi Apparatus]]
- [[Lysosomes]]

The following organelles are exclusively found in *animals*:
- [[Centrioles]]

The following organelles are exclusively found in *plants*:
- [[Cell Wall]]
- [[Plastids]]
- [[Vacuole]]
