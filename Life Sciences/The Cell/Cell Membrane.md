# Cell Membrane
#gr10/Q1 #biochemistry/organic-cells/organelles #biochemistry/organic-cells/plant-cells #biochemistry/organic-cells/animal-cells

[[The Cell]] membrane surrounds a cell. It is *differentially permeable*, meaning it can control what comes into and out of [[the cell]]. All cells have cell membranes, and which allow [[Osmosis]] to occur. This means cell membranes are vital to [[Transport in Cells]]. 

## Structure of the Cell Membrane. 
The current accepted theory of the *structure of [[the cell]] membrane* is the *Fluid-Mosaic Model*. It is called "fluid" because it can move and stretch as needed. There are [[proteins]] that "float" in the membrane that allow substances that are too large to diffuse into [[the cell]]. On the inside of [[the Cell]] Membrane is the cytoplasm, a fluid kept inside by the hydrophobic fatty acid trails. There is also a layer of moisture on the outside of [[the cell]] that allows [[Diffusion]].

## Functions of the Cell-Membrane
- Encloses [[the cell]]’s contents
- Selectively permeable – controls what enters and exits [[the cell]]
- Communicates with other nearby cells
