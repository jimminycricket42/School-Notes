# Mitosis
#GR10/Q2 #biochemistry/organic-cells/cell-division

Cells exist in two phases - interphase and division phase. Interphase is the time where [[the cell]] performs its regular functions, and the DNA replicates. Interphase ends when the division phase begins. Cells increase by means of mitosis, which is a *continuous* process where *exact genetic replicas* of [[the cell]] are made. This allows our body to grow and repair damaged cells.

## Structure of the Chromosome
The main thing that is replicated is the chromosomes, which are “strings” that store the genetic information of [[the cell]]. Chromosomes have the following structure:

>*All* human cells have 46 chromosomes, but the number of chromosomes changes from species to species

## Stages of Mitosis
Mitosis is a continuous process, but we can clearly distinguish 4 phases. 
We can remember the stages of Mitosis with the acronym: PMAT
P - Prophase
M -  Metaphase
A - Anaphase
T - Telophase

### Prophase
During prophase the [[Nucleus|Nuclear Membrane]] disappears and the chromosomes become visible. One chromosomes contain 2 identical DNA molecules. Additionally, the centrioles start to move apart to opposite poles of the cells.

### Metaphase
during this phase the Chromosomes align, and the [[centrioles]] have reached opposite poles and begin to form spindle fibres between them and the chromosomes.

### Anaphase
During anaphase the spindle fibres shrink, pulling the chromosomes apart by splitting the centromere and separating the chromatids. The chromatids, which are now known as daughter chromosomes, begin to move to opposite sides of [[the cell]].

### Telophase
The daughter chromosomes join to farm a chromatin network. The DNA/chromatin of the two cells are completely identical. The nuclear membrane and the nucleolus reappears, and an invagination forms in between the two cells. The invagination is formed through *cytokinesis*.

## Cancer – Uncontrolled Mitosis
Cancer is defined as uncontrolled mitosis. [[The cell]] 'forgets' to stop and go into interphase after cell division. Oncologists are not sure what causes this, but *carcinogens* are known to increase the likelihood of contracting cancer. Cancer was once a death sentence, but nowadays  he have many ways to treat or remove cancer, for example: Surgery, Radiation therapy, and Chemotherapy 
Cancer forms *tumours*, which are masses of *non-functioning extra cells* that  keep on dividing . Mitosis requires energy, and so, the tumour takes energy from the organism, affecting it’s function
We classify cancers as either *malignant* or *benign*. Benign cancers are singular tumour that remain in one place in the body. Malignant cancers break apart and enter the [[Blood|bloodstream]], spreading to the rest of the body and attacking far more aggressively than a benign tumour.
