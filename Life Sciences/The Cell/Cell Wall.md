# Cell Wall

The cell wall is a non-living fully permeable layer of [[Carbohydrates#^570345|cellulose]] that is fully permeable. It surrounds the [[cell membrane]] of a plant cell, and provides shape, support, and protection to the plant cell through *turgor pressure*.

## Turgor Pressure
Turgor pressure is the pressure exerted by the organelles against the cell wall. In plant cells, this is mainly created by the [[Vacuole]] filling with water and pressing against the edges of the cell, creating an inward pressure through [[Newtons Third Law]] that gives the cell wall strength.
