# Mitochondria
The mitochondria is responsible for performing [[Cellular Respiration]]. It takes [[Carbohydrates#Monosaccharides|glucose]] and transforms it into [[ATP]], which [[The Cell]] uses to perform many functions. 

## Structure of a Mitochondrion

They are small, oval-shaped structures with a double membrane â€“ a folded inner membrane and a smooth outer membrane. 

## Role of the Mitochondria in Cellular Respiration
[[Cellular Respiration]] happens in and around the Mitochondrion. 
1. The first phase of cellular respiration, [[Cellular Respiration#Glycosis|Glycosis]] occurs in the cytosol, just outside of the mitochondria. 
2. The second phase of cellular respiration, [[Cellular Respiration#Krebs Cycle|Krebs Cycle]] occurs inside the mitochondrion.
3. The third phase of cellular respiration, [[Cellular Respiration#Oxidative Phosphorylation|Oxidative Phosphorylation]] occurs on the cristae of a mitochondrion.
