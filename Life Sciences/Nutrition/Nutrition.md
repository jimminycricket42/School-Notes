# Nutrition
Nutrition refers to how plants and animals gain the nutrients and [[Organic and Inorganic Compounds|organic compounds]] that they need to survive. ^blurb

Plants are mostly [[Autotrophs]], meaning they can [[Photosynthesis|photosynthesise]] to produce their own food.

Animals and some plants are [[Heterotrophs]], meaning they must rely on digesting other organisms for them to gain the compounds that they need. This is covered further in [[Nutrition in Animals]]. 

## Necessity of Food
Food is necessary for all animals. Food is the source of energy for all organisms, which allows them to perform their daily functions.
Additionally, food provides the materials for the *growth and repair of damaged tissues*. 
Lastly food is necessary for the regulation of body processes, like [[Cellular Respiration]] and [[Egestion]].
