# Ingestion
Ingestion is the process of taking in nutrients and transporting them to the [[The Digestive System|digestive system]]. It takes place in [[The Mouth]] of humans and animals. ^blurb

Here, mechanical and chemical [[Nutrition in Animals|Digestion]] begin to take place. The teeth grind down the food into a *bolus*, while [[Enzymes|Salivary Amylase]] begin breaking down complex carbohydrates. 

The bolus is then pushed into the [[The Oesophagus|oesophagus]] by the tongue. [[Muscles#^Peristalsis|Peristalsis]] then pushes the food into the [[The Stomach|stomach]], where [[Digestion]] takes place.
