# Egestion
Undigested waste moves from the [[The Small Intestine|small intestine]] into the [[The Large Intestine|large intestine]]. Here, the remaining water is removed from the waste before it is stored in the [[The Rectum|rectum]] as *faeces*.  ^blurb

Muscle contractions in the rectum and muscle relaxations in the anus causes faeces to be expelled in the process known as *defecation*.

> [!note] The role of Roughage in Nutrition
> Roughage is indigestible substances found in plant material, including cellulose, lignin, and pectin. It promotes peristalsis in the oesophagus and intestines, prevents constipation and hemorrhoid's and softens faeces for easier defecation.
