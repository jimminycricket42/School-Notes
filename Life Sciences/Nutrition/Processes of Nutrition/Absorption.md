# Absorption
Absorption is the process of nutrients moving from the digestive system into the [[Blood Vessels|blood steam]] through diffusion. This means that the bolus in the [[The Small Intestine|Small intestine]] must be in a soluble state so that it may pass through the [[Villi]]. Most [[monomers]] are soluble, except [[Lipids]] which require the help of bile salts from the [[The Liver|gall bladder]] to be absorbed.  ^blurb

Within the [[The Small Intestine|Small Intestine]] there are [[Villi]] which facilitate absorption. Combined with the length of the small intestine, this gives the body plenty of time to absorb what it needs from food. 

![[Villi#Adaptations of the Villus to Facilitate Absorption]]

## The Absorption Process
- [[Carbohydrates|Glucose]] is actively absorbed into the [[Blood Vessels|blood capillaries]] within the villus.
- [[Proteins|Amino acids]] are actively absorbed into the [[Blood Vessels|blood capillaries]] within the villus through the use of *protein carriers*.  
- [[Lipids|Fatty Acids and Glycerol]] are passively absorbed by diffusion into the lacteals, with the aid of bile salts. 
- [[Organic and Inorganic Compounds|Vitamins]] can be fat soluble or water soluble. 
	- *Fat soluble vitamins* such as A, D, E, and K are passively absorbed into the [[Blood Vessels|blood capillaries]]. 
	- *Water soluble vitamins*  such as B and C are passively absorbed or aided by carrier molecules.
- Water is absorbed via [[Osmosis]] into the [[Blood Vessels|blood capillaries]]. 

## Transport of Absorbed Substances
After [[#The Absorption Process]], substances in the [[Lymphatic System]] and substances in the [[The Circulatory System]] go to different places. 

### Transport through the Lymphatic System
[[Lipids|Lipids and glycerol]] are moved through the [[Lymphatic System|lymphatic system]] until they eventually end up in the *thoracic duct*. Here, they are deposited into the blood system through the *left subclavian vein*, and the heart distributes them throughout the body. 

### Transport through the Circulatory System
[[Carbohydrates|Glucose]], [[Proteins|amino acids]], [[Organic and Inorganic Compounds|Vitamins]] and [[Organic and Inorganic Compounds|Minerals]] are transported from where they are absorbed into the liver through the *hepatic portal vein*. 

In the liver, most of the Glucose is converted into Glycogen for storage. Any remaining glucose is sent to the inferior vena cava for distribution to the body via the circulatory system. Majority of the Glucose goes to tissues where it is converted into energy via [[Cellular Respiration]]. 

Amino acids are sent to the inferior vena cava after separating any excess amino acids. Excess amino acids are converted into urea, which is sent to the kidneys to be removed from the body as urine.
