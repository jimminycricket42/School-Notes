# Digestion
Digestion is the process of taking complex ingested substances and breaking them down into smaller, soluble [[Monomers|monomers]]. This is necessary, as only soluble substances can be [[Absorption|absorbed]] into the body.  ^blurb

We can distinguish between two types of digestion:
- [[#Mechanical Digestion]]
- [[#Chemical Digestion]]

## Mechanical Digestion
Mechanical digestion breaks down large clumps of food into smaller clumps, *increasing the surface area* of the substances for chemical digestion to work on it.

Mechanical Digestion mainly occurs in the stomach, but many points along the alimentary canal cause mechanical digestion. 

Throughout the whole alimentary canal, the rythmic contraction of [[Muscles#^Peristalsis|Peristalsis]] mechanically digest some foods .

## Chemical Digestion
Chemical digestion is the breakdown of large *polymers* into smaller, soluble [[monomers]] through *hydrolysis*. Hydrolysis is a catabolic reaction that breaks the bonds between food molecules with the assistance of [[Enzymes]].
