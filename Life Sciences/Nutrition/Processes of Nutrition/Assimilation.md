# Assimilation
Assimilation is the process where nutrients that have undergone absorption are moved from the blood stream into the cells. This is to satisfy the basic needs of [[The Cell]], allowing it to repair itself and replicate to form [[Biological Organisation|tissues]]. ^blurb

Assimilation is controlled by hormones, and is part of the reason why [[Homeostasis]] is so important. If assimilation cannot take place, then cells such as the muscles of the heart cannot function properly, and therefore the organism dies.
