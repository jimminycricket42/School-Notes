# Villi
Villi are small transverse folds found mainly in the [[The Small Intestine|small intestine]]. They increase the surface of absorption tremendously, and are specially adapted to do so. It facilitates absorption of glucose, vitamins, mineral salts, amino acids, waters and fats.  It has a single layer of [[Epithelium#Cuboidal Epithelium|cuboidal epithelium]] that allows it to do so. ^blurb

## Adaptations of the Villus to Facilitate Absorption
Villi are tissues with *one-layer thick epithelium* to *increase the surface area for [[absorption]]*. The villus is *rich in [[Blood Vessels|capillaries]] for* the absorption of glucose, amino acids, vitamins, mineral salts and water. In the centre of the villus is a *lacteal that facilitates the absorption of fats*. On the outside of the villi is *microvilli that increase surface area for absorption*, as well as *goblet cells that secrete mucous* in which nutrients dissolve. Lastly, the villus has *many [[Mitochondria]] to provide energy for active transport*
