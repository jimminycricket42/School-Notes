# Nutrition in Animals
Animals are unable to produce their own [[Organic and Inorganic Compounds]]. To obtain these compounds, animals will eat other organisms. The compounds they ingest are complex and insoluble, meaning they cannot be immediately absorbed and used by the body. They must first be broken down into soluble nutrients. Food is processed within the [[The Digestive System|alimentary canal]] of most organism. ^blurb

## Processes of Nutrition
To break down complex compounds into simpler, soluble nutrients the compounds undergo five processes:
- [[Ingestion]] – Taking of food into the [[alimentary canal]]
- [[Digestion]] – Food is broken up mechanically and chemically into simpler substances.
- [[Absorption]] – Nutrients are absorbed into the blood stream for usage in other parts of the body. 
- [[Assimilation]] – The cells take in the nutrients for use in their functioning. 
- [[Egestion]] – Waste products is stored in the rectum before removal through defecation.
