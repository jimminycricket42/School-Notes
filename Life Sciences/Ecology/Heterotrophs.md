# Heterotrophs
Heterotrophs are organisms that depend on energy from other pre-existing [[Organic and Inorganic Compounds]] found in their [[Ecosystems]]. They consume [[Autotrophs]] or other [[Heterotrophs]] for food and energy. ^Heterotroph-blurb

## Types of Heterotrophs
Heterotrophs can be:
- *Herbivores*: Plant-eating primary consumers
- *Carnivores*: Meat-eating secondary consumers
- *Omnivores*: Plant- and Meat-eating tertiary consumers
- *Decomposers*: Dead-organic-matter decomposers (Saprotrophs)

> Saprotrophâ€™s are organisms that feed on *dead organic matter*, A.K.A. decomposers and scavengers. It can be seen as a subclass of heterotroph that consists of fungi, bacteria, and water-moulds.

### Heterotrophsâ€™ Role in Ecosystems
Heterotrophs make up a large part of the [[Energy Flow]] in an [[Ecosystems]]. They fulfil the roles of [[Energy Flow|primary consumer]], [[Energy Flow|secondary consumer]], [[Energy Flow|tertiary consumer]], and [[Energy Flow|decomposer]]
