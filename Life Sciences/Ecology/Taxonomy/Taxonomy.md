# Taxonomy
Taxonomy is the study of the classification of animals. It encompasses [[Biodiversity]] and the classification of animals according to the taxonomic levels. ^blurb

## Levels of Taxonomy 
There are seven levels of classification commonly used:
- [[#Kingdom]]
- [[#Phylum]]
- [[#Class]]
- [[#Order]]
- [[#Family]]
- [[#Genus]] 
- [[#Species]]

### Kingdom
The kingdom is the largest and vaguest classification. The organisms often share few characteristics, but that combination of those characteristics are unique to that organism. 

The kingdoms are:
- Monera
- Protista
- Fungi
- Plantae
- Animalia


### Phylum
Phyla have less organisms than kingdom, and these are decided on a few traits. They're decided on a general trait that appear in their kingdom. Such as: do they have a shell (mollusc), or do they have a backbone (chordates).

### Class
Class is determined by the layout of organs and internals, and how complex those organs are. At class the rules start to break down, and we see the naming fall to individual or teams of taxonomists.

### Order
Order is small than class, and it starts being real specific, often requiring a taxonomist to view and decide on what order an animal belongs. order does not mean the same thing between botany and zoology.

### Family
They share many similar characteristics, and need a taxonomist to determine what family an organism belongs in. 

### Genus 
A genus is the second smallest classification. All the organisms in a genus have very similar traits. Most of them have one or two defining factors for each species. It takes a taxonomist to determine an organisms genus

### Species
This contains individual species, and all organisms in a species can breed and reproduce, and all share the same characteristics. This also has to be determined by a taxonomist.

## Naming Species
Species are named scientifically to avoid confusion between colloquial names or names in different languages. For this reason Carl Linnaeus developed the binomial naming system. This name is made of the [[#Genus]] name and the [[#Species]] name. 

### Rules for writing names
1. The name is in italics
2. The genus name comes first and is capitalized
3. The species name is not capitalized 
4. The name is only written out fully the first time in a paragraph
