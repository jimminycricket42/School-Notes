# Autotrophs
Autotrophs are *green, photosynthesizing plants* that produce [[Organic and Inorganic Compounds]] through various means. They are the [[Energy Flow|producers]] of energy in their [[Ecosystems]]. They create energy for [[Heterotrophs]] to consume. ^Autotroph-blurb



## Autotrophsâ€™ Role in Ecosystems
Autotrophs are [[Energy Flow|producers]], making them essential for all [[ecosystems]]. 

### Autotrophs and the Nutrient Cycles
Autotrophs also play roles in [[The Nutrient Cycles]]. They produce *Oxygen* as a bi-product of [[Photosynthesis]], which uses *Water* and *Carbon* to produce [[Carbohydrates]] and other organic molecules, such as [[Proteins]], which use *Nitrates* found in the [[The Nitrogen Cycle|nitrogen cycle]]. 

## Creation of Organic Substances by Autotrophs
Autotrophs use *Radiant Energy* from the sun, as well as water, carbon, oxygen, and other elements to create [[Carbohydrates]] and [[Proteins|amino acids]]. This is done through [[Photosynthesis]]

## Types of Autotrophs
- Green Plants
- Algae
- Phytoplankton

## Extra: Non-photosynthesizing Autotrophs
Some autotrophs do not need radiant energy to photosynthesize. They use another process called *chemosynthesis* to produce energy that they then use to create carbohydrates.

This occurs in unique circumstances where the organism lives in an environment with extreme conditions. These organisms are found around [[Volcanoes]] and [[History of Tectonic Plates|oceanic vents]] where there are toxic substances that allow oxidation to occur. The energy released by oxidation is then used to create [[Organic and Inorganic Compounds|organic compounds]].
