# Ecosystems
Living organisms are constantly interacting with with each other, as well as other non-living components that together make up an area. These areas have an *[[energy flow]]* within them. Ecosystems can be any size, and it can be said that [[The Biosphere]] is the ecosystem of the earth. On the flip side, a drop of water could be an entire ecosystem. ^blurb

Ecosystems are made up of two components:
- Biotic Components
- Abiotic Components

## Abiotic Components of Ecosystems
Within Abiotic Components of an area, we have a number of factors:
- Physiographic Factors 🌍
- Edaphic Factors 🪨
- Light 🔦
- Temperature 🌡
- Water 💦
- Atmospheric Gasses ☁
- Wind 🌬

### Physiographic Factors 🌍
Physiographic Factors are things to do with natural features. In particular, we look at:
- Aspect
- Slope
- Altitude

> [!note]- Link to Geography
> This links to the [[Temperatures of different places in the world]], which is a part of climatology. 

#### Aspect 
The aspect is the direction a slope faces. Any slopes facing towards the equator are warmer, as they receive more direct sunlight due to the curvature of the earth. 

🪴Some plants prefer the warm, sunny side

🪴Some plants prefer the cool, shady side 

This also affects the properties of the soil, namely what [[#types of soil]] are found on that slope.

#### Slope 
Slopes have different *[[gradients]]*, and this changes the properties of the soil on certain kinds of slopes.

Steeper slopes have *fast water run-off*, which *degrades the topsoil* and rids the nutrients of vital [[#humus]] and nutrients. This soil is often *fallow*, and few plants or animals are found there. 

Shallow slopes have *slow water run-off*, which is far less damaging than steeper slopes, but may lead to flooding and drowning of plants. 

#### Height Above Sea Level 
Areas that are high above sea level generally have thinner air, and more extreme weather. This can make the area inhospitable for many species of plants and animals. 

### Edaphic Factors 🪨
There are 3 types of soil: *clay*, *loam*, and *sand*, and we look at their:
- Soil Air
- Water-holding capacity
- Humus content
- pH

Clay is made up of small particles with little soil air and a high water-holding capacity. It is also normally alkaline.

Loam is made up of moderately-sized particles, with good soil-air, and a moderate water-holding capacity. It is normally neutral. 

Sand is made up of large-sized particles, with lots of soil air and a low water-holding capacity. It is also normally acidic. 

#### Soil Air
The different types of soils have different amounts of air within them. This is due to the spaces between particles. This is very important for the living organisms to survive. We call this property *aeration*. 

*Clay* has very *little air* between particles. 
*Loam* has *moderate amounts of air* between particles. 
*Sand* has large *amounts of air* between particles. 

#### Water-holding capacity
The different types of soils have different water holding capacities. This is due to different spaces between particles. This changes the viability of the soil for sustaining life. If there is too much water in the soil, the plants drown. If the water drains too fast, it leeches the nutrients from the soil and makes it fallow. The higher the water holding capacity, the more water the soil will hold. 

*Clay* has a high water holding capacity, and is prone to flooding. 
*Loam* has a moderate water holding capacity, and is the most suitable for plant growth. 
*Sand* has low a water holding capacity, and is prone to leeching. 

#### Humus Content
Humus is the decayed plant and animal matter found within topsoil. Fungi and bacteria found here help with releasing nutrients back into the soil. The humus increases the fertility of the soil, and it can increase the water-holding capacity. 

> [!note]+ Spotting High Humus Levels
> Soil with high levels of humus have darker colours. 

#### pH
pH can change where plants grow – some plants prefer certain types of soil. 

Clay soil is alkaline, and some plants (like succulents) prefer alkaline soil. 
Loam soil is neutral, and most plants prefer neutral soil.
Sandy soil is acidic, and some plants (like fynbos) prefer acidic soil. 

### Light 🔦
Organisms, especially plants require light. Plants need light for [[Photosynthesis]], and different plants need different amounts of light. Most plants thrive in bright light, but others need shady conditions. Too much light can damage the plant tissues. 

Some plants will turn to face light, increasing the exposure, while others will wait for the light intensity to drop before they begin [[Plastids|photosynthesis]]. The difference between these two allow us to decide whether a plant is a *sun-preferring plant* or a *shade-preferring plant*.

### Temperature
Organisms are required to survive in a large range of temperatures. This means that they require different mechanisms to survive such a wide range of temperatures. [[#Animals Mechanisms to Regulate their Temperature|Animals]] use different methods to survive temperatures. Plans and trees enter a state of dormancy to survive colder months, or have adapted to the cold weather. 

#### Animals Mechanisms to Regulate their Temperature
Animals can be *endothermic* or *ectothermic*. 

##### Endothermic – Self-regulation
Endothermic (warm blooded) animals *can regulate their own internal temperatures* (to a limited extent). This allows them to survive hot and cold conditions easily. 

Some endothermic animals will *migrate* if the weather is still too extreme for them to survive in. 

Some endothermic animals will also *hibernate* if the weather is too cold, or *aestivate* if it is too warm. Hibernation and Aestivation are when animals enter a ‘sleep’, in which their *metabolism, [[Breathing]], and heartrate decrease* in order to conserve resources. 

- [I] **Eg**. Birds and mammals are endothermic animals

##### Ectothermic Regulation – Environmental regulation
Ectothermic (cold-blooded) animals *cannot regulate their own internal temperatures* and *become inactive* when the temperature reaches extremes. They tend to favour a warm or a cold climate, as that is what is survivable to them. 

Some endothermic animals will  *hibernate* if the weather is too cold, or *aestivate* if it is too warm. Hibernation and Aestivation are when animals enter a ‘sleep’, in which their *metabolism, [[Breathing]], and heartrate decrease* in order to conserve resources. 

- [I] **Eg**. Fish, amphibians and reptiles are all ectothermic animals. 

#### Plant’s Mechanisms to Regulate their Temperature
Small plants can be classified as Annual plants or Perennial plants, depending on how they enter dormancy. 
##### Perennial Plants
Perennial plants live all year round, but lose their *aerial parts* and begin *hibernation* when the temperature drops. 

##### Annual Plants
Annual plants live within one season, completing their entire lifecycle before the temperature drops. They survive the winter months as seeds that germinate when the temperature rises again.

#### Trees Mechanisms to regulate their temperature
Trees are either *deciduous* or *evergreen*. 

##### Deciduous
Deciduous trees lose their leaves in winter and slow their metabolism in order to hibernate through winter. 

##### Evergreen
Evergreen trees keep their leaves in winter, but have other adaptations in order to survive harsh temperatures. 

### Water
All living organisms require water to survive. Plants and animals have both adapted to survive with the amount of water available to them 

#### Plants’ dependence on water
Plants can be classified by their dependence on water. We group them into 3 categories:
- Hydrophytes – need a large supply of water
- Mesophytes – needs a moderate supply of water
- Xerophytes – needs a small supply of water

#####  Hydrophytes
Hydrophytes need a large supply of water – they are dependant on it. They grow in or around water. 

> [!info] Extra: Adaptations of Hydrophytes
> Hydrophytes have no waxy cuticle to allow water to run off easily. They have very little or even no [[Vascular tissue|xylem]], and they have large spaces filled with air so that they can float easily.

An example of a hydrophytes is water-lilies

##### Mesophytes
Mesophytes require a moderate supply of water. 

An example of a mesophyte is corn

##### Xerophytes 
Xerophytes needs a small supply of water. They can live in very dry climates, far away from water. 

> [!info] Extra: Adaptations of Xerophytes
> Xerophytes have a smaller area for evaporation because they swapped leaves for thicker stems and thorns that prevent water evaporation. They also store water in the stem and roots 

#### Animals Adaptations due to Water
Many animals have adapted to low water. There are many of these adaptations across millions of species, however there are a few interesting ones we look at:
- Insects have a thick, waxy exoskeleton to prevent water from evaporating out of their shell. 
- Gemsbok and Camels both have digestive systems that absorb almost all the water they take in. 
- Bats and similar animals are nocturnal to prevent dehydration from heat.
- Moles, earthworms, and similar animals burrow underground to avoid high heats. 
- Reptiles have dry, scaly skin to prevent water loss

Additionally, there are some animals who live exclusively in water. We call these animals *aquatic animals*. 
- Fish have gills that allow them to perform [[Gaseous Exchange]] underwater. 
- Whales, dolphins, and seals have [[Lungs]] that require them to come up to the surface to breathe. 

#### The Water Cycle
[[The Water Cycle]] is the what name the continuous flow of water between the earth and the [[The Atmosphere|atmosphere]]. 

Water moves from the [[The Atmosphere|atmosphere]] to the earth as [[precipitation]]. This [[precipitation]] can either  join an existing water body, or it can join the *water table*. From there, it is either evaporated by the sun or transpired from plants who absorbed the groundwater, becoming water-vapor. The water-vapor will eventually cool, and condense into [[precipitation]]. 

### Atmospheric Gasses
The [[The Atmosphere|atmosphere]] is made up of many gasses in varying Quantities. These gasses all cycle in the [[The Nutrient Cycles]] in order to maintain a constant amount of each. 

All organisms (except for anaerobic Bacteria) require *oxygen* to live. Land- and air-based organisms take it from [[the atmosphere]], Water-based organisms take it from the hydrosphere, and ground organisms take it from the [[Structure of the Earth|lithosphere]]. Plants also absorb nitrogen from the soil, which is then transferred through the [[Energy Flow|tropic levels]] to animals before being decomposed and re-released into [[the atmosphere]] as part of the [[The Nitrogen Cycle|nitrogen cycle]]. 

#### Land- and Air-based Organisms Method of Receiving Oxygen
Land based organisms have mostly developed [[Lungs]] for [[Gaseous Exchange]], but some (such as amphibians) have a layer of moisture that allows them to perform [[Gaseous Exchange]]. 

#### Water-based Organisms Method of Receiving Oxygen
Water-based organisms rely on gills to filter out oxygen to breathe, but underwater mammals use large [[Lungs]] to perform [[Gaseous Exchange]]. Underwater plants have a thin cuticle and no epidermis to create a surface viable for [[Gaseous Exchange]]. 

#### Ground-based Organisms Method of Receiving Oxygen
Plants have stomata that allow them to perform [[Gaseous Exchange]] and [[Transpiration]]. Some woody plants use *lenticels* to facilitate [[Gaseous Exchange]]. 


### Wind
Wind increases the rate of evaporation and [[transpiration]], increasing the speed of [[The Water Cycle]], as well as increasing water loss in organisms. 

## Biotic Components of Ecosystems
Ecosystems are made up of two biotic components
- the [[Autotrophs|Autotrophic]] component
- The [[Heterotrophs|Heterotrophic]] component

### The Autotrophic Component
[[Autotrophs]] are green photosynthesizing plants. They are the [[Energy Flow|producers]] in an ecosystem, as they produce their own [[Organic and Inorganic Compounds|organic compounds]] through [[Photosynthesis]]. 
![[Autotrophs#^Autotroph-blurb]]

### The Heterotrophic Component
[[Heterotrophs]] are organisms that depend on [[Organic and Inorganic Compounds|organic compounds]] from other organisms in order to produce energy. Consumers and Decomposers are [[heterotrophs]]. They rely on [[Autotrophs]]
![[Heterotrophs#^Heterotroph-blurb]]
