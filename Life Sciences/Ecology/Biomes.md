# Biomes
Biomes are areas defined by the climate and organisms present that form a partially closed system. They are the largest ecological unit after [[The Biosphere]]. Biomes can be classified as *aquatic biomes* or *terrestrial biomes* ^blurb

## Terrestrial Biomes
- Forest
- Savannah
- Grassland
- Nama-Karoo
- Succulent-Karoo
- Fynbos
- Thicket

### Savannah
Savannah are the largest biomes we study. They are found in the north of South Africa

**Plants**: Acacia; Baobab; Grasses

**Animals**: Lions; Elephants; Kingfishers

#### Climate
**Summer**: Warm temperature, moist

**Winter**: Cold temperature, with [[Precipitation|frost]] forming

---

### Grassland
Grasslands are found in central-eastern South Africa. It is the second larges biome we study

**Plants**: Sweet and Sour grasses

**Animals**: Blue cranes, Guinea fowl, Wildebeest 

#### Climate
**Summer**: Warm temperature with thunderstorms 

**Winter**: Cold temperature, with lots of [[Precipitation|frost]] forming

---
### Nama-Karoo
Nama-Karoo is found in western South Africa. They are large plateau landscapes. 

**Plants**: Grasses and Shrubs; Christmas berry; sweet thorns

**Animals**: Sheep; Goats; Riverine rabbit

#### Climate
**Summer**: Hot temperature â€“ a semi-desert

**Winter**: Cold temperature with [[Precipitation|frost]] forming

---
### Succulent-Karoo
The succulent karoo is found in western South Africa and is similar to the Nama-karoo, but has more succulent plants. 

**Plants**: Stone plants; quiver trees; succulents

**Animals**: Meerkat; bat-eared foxes

#### Climate
**Summer**: Hot temperature with dry weather

**Winter**: Cold temperature with wet weather

---
### Fynbos
The fynbos is found in south-westers South Africa and is one of the words most ecologically rich regions with its endemic flowers, the fynbos

**Plants**: Fynbos; Proteas; Ericas; Restios

**Animals**: Baboons; Leopards; Dassies

#### Climate
**Summer**: Moderate temperature with dry weather

**Winter**: Moderate temperature with wet weather 

---
### Thicket
Thickets are found in coastal eastern South Africa. 

**Plants**: Spekboom; Plumbago 

**Animals**: Kudu; Bush-buck; vervet monkeys; elephants

#### Climate
**Summer**: Various

**Winter**: Various

---

### Forest Biome
Forest biomes are found on the east coast of South Africa. It is the smallest biome we study. 

**Plants**: Yellowwood; Creepers; Ferns

**Animals**: Bush-buck; Monkeys; Bush-pigs

#### Climate
**Summer**: Moderate temperature, high [[Precipitation|rain]]

**Winter**: Moderate temperature, high [[Precipitation|rain]]

## Aquatic Biomes
We look at:
- Wetlands Biome

### Wetlands Biome
The wetlands Biome is found in north-eastern South Africa. 

**Plants**: Aquatic Plants

**Animals**: Birds; mammals; reptiles; amphibians

#### Importance of Wetlands in the Water Cycle
Wetlands are covered in a layer of water, either permanently or seasonally, and are responsible for regular, filtered water reaching animals and plants further downstream. Wetlands use plants and silts to filter out toxins, leading to a large amount of biodiversity in wetlands. They also control floods that can have irreparable damage to [[ecosystems]].
