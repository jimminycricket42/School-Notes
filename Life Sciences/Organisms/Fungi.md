# Fungi
Fungi are the most complex microorganism we study. They can be found microscopically or macroscopically. They vary wildly in structure, and can be found in many different environments. They can be seperated into microscopic yeasts, or macroscopic mushrooms and moulds. ^blurb

## General Characteristics
Fungi are [[Classification of Cells|eukaryotes]] that have cell walls made of chitin. They are made up of a series of branched filaments, known as hyphae that transfer nutrients and perform functions. 

All fungi are [[Heterotrophs]], with many being [[Heterotrophs#^saprotrophs|saprophytes]] that feed off of dead matter. Some are [[symbiosis|parasites]], like athletes foot, but many are [[symbiosis|mutualistic]]. 

### Reproduction
Unicellular fungi reproduce through binary fission

Multicellular fungi reproduce through spores when they can, but can also reproduce sexually through gametes. 

## Structure
Fungi are [[Classification of Cells|eukaryotes]] that are multicellular. Their chitin cell wall protects the cytoplasm. The cells of fungi arrange themselves into hyphae. 

We generally look to *Rhizopus* (bread mould) as a general structure of a fungus. 

The *hyphae* weave together to form a body, known as the *mycelium*. Some mycilia would have roots, but *Rhizopus* has no roots, making it a *thallus*. 

There are three types of distinguishable hyphae:
- Stolons – branch horizontally on the surface of the substrate
- Rhizoids – Stolons that penetrate the surface of the substrate
- Sporangiophores – hyphae that grow vertically to produce spores
