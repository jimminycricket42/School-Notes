# Viruses
Viruses are the strangest microorganism we study, but that makes them the most interesting. They are not alive, as they do not satisfy the [[Characteristics of Life]], but they are not dead, as they show signs of life. They can reproduce, but they require a host cell to do so, making them [[pathogens|pathogenic]]. Lastly, viruses don’t consist of [[The Cell|cells]], and are therefore neither [[Classification of Cell Structure|prokaryotes or eukaryotes]].  ^blurb

## General Characteristics
Viruses are *obligate intracellular parasites*. They only affect *one type* of host, or only one type of cell. They are [[pathogens|pathogenic]], and cause diseases.

> *Obligate* is a form of oblige, meaning something is compulsory.
> *Intracellular* means that something occurs within a cell.
> *Parasite* is a type of organism that lives on other living material and only causes harm.

> Putting this all together, *obligate intracellular parasite* means an organism that must exist within a cell to live through parasitism. 

As parasites, viruses are technically [[Heterotrophs|heterotrophic]] and perform symbiosis. However, because they do not store [[energy]] they are not real [[heterotrophs]]. Rather, their parasitism allows them to reproduce. 

### Reproduction
Viruses will infect a host cell and instruct it to convert its own genetic material (DNA and RNA) into viral nucleic acid, which is used to create more viruses.

## Structure
![[Virus Diagram.jpg]]

Viruses are very small, acellular particles. They have a central nucleic acid that is surrounded by a protective protein capsule. They contain only DNA or RNA, which they use to infect host [[The Cell|cells]]. 

Some viruses have a sheath of [[Lipids]] and [[Proteins]]. This protects the nucleic acid from the human immune system. 

Viruses vary in shape, but generally follow one of three:
- Rod Shaped, such as TMV
- Spherical, such as Adenovirus
- Complex, such as bacteriophages
