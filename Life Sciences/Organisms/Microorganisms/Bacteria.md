# Bacteria
Bacteria were the first lifeforms to exist on earth. They are [[Classification of Cell Structure|prokaryotes]] that are present in our every day lives. Bacteria can cause diseases, and will partake in [[symbiosis]], but many of them are good for humans. They are also used in multiple fields of biotechnology. ^blurb

## General Characteristics

Bacteria are simple, and unicellular. However, they still have variation in their method of obtaining nutrients. The majority of bacteria are [[Heterotrophs]], but some are [[Autotrophs]]. 

### Autotrophic Bacteria
Cyanobacteria – the bacteria that kick started life on earth – is a photosynthesizing bacteria. Many other early bacteria perform [[Autotrophs#Extra: Non-photosynthesizing Autotrophs|chemosynthesis]]. 

### Heterotrophic Bacteria
The majority of bacteria are [[Heterotrophs]], meaning they receive their nutrients from other species. There are multiple types of heterotrophic bacteria:
- [[symbiosis|Parasitic]] bacteria that obtain food from living organisms.
- [[Heterotrophs#^saprotrophs|saphrotrophic]] bacteria that obtain food from dead organisms.
- [[symbiosis|Mutualistic]] bacteria that obtain food from living organisms while benefiting the organism.

> Nodule bacteria, which forms a part of [[The Nitrogen Cycle]], lives in the root nodules of legumes. They absorb free Nitrogen gas within the soil, converting it into nitrates for the plant to absorb. The plant gives the bacteria carbohydrates in exchange. 

### Reproduction of bacteria
Bacteria reproduce asexually through a method known as *binary fission*. This is very similar to mitosis, where one cell splits into two genetically identical copies.

## Structure

Bacteria are always unicellular, and they have no true [[Nucleus]]. This makes them [[Classification of Cell Structure|prokaryotes]]. 

Bacteria have a [[cell membrane]] and a [[cell wall]], and some [[Microorganisms|Pathogens]] bacteria have a slime layer surrounding it to protect the cytoplasm. Sometimes flagellum can be found, which allow the bacteria to move. 

Within the cytoplasm there are [[ribosomes]], but no membrane bound organelles.

### Shapes of bacteria

- Vibrio – boomerang
- Bacillis – rod
- Coccus – round
- Spirillium – spiral

## Artificial Production of Insulin using Bacteria
DNA from different organisms are cut and spliced together, using recombinant DNA technology. 

Within humans, this is used to produce insulin. DNA from a E-Coli bacteria (which lives in the gut) is cut using a restrictive enzymes. Then, DNA removed from the human pancreas that contain the gene codes for the production of insulin is inserted into the *plasmid* of the bacteria. The enzyme *ligase* will connect the two, and the plasmid will reform into a circle, and reproduce with every subsequent generation of bacteria. These modified E-coli are put into a fermentation tank where they replicate, before the insulin is harvested.
