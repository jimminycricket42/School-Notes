# Microorganisms
Microorganisms are a [[Classification]] of organisms that cannot be seen with the naked eye. They are abundant on earth, and can be found almost everywhere. Many of them barely affect us, but those that do are known as *pathogens*. ^blurb

> [!note]+ :spiral_notepad: Are Microorganisms harmful to Humans and Animals?
> Most microorganisms have no effect on animals, in fact there are some that we need to survive. However, bad microorganisms do exist, and they are known as *pathogens*. All [[Viruses]] are pathogenic, as well as some [[Bacteria]], [[Protista]], and [[Fungi]]. They are symbiotic, and cause *infectious diseases*.

## Classifications of Microorganisms
In order of size:
[[Viruses]] → [[Bacteria]] → [[Protista]] → [[Fungi]] 

[[Viruses]] are non-living, while [[Bacteria]], protista, and fungi are all living. ^[[[Characteristics of Life]]]

### Cell Structure
We can classify microorganisms by their cell structure, namely if they are [[Classification of Cell Structure|prokaryotes]] or [[Classification of Cell Structure|eukaryotes]]. 
- [[Viruses]] are Acellular, and are therefore neither prokaryotic nor eukaryotic. 
- [[Bacteria]] are prokaryotic, because they don’t have a true [[nucleus]] nor a nuclear membrane, and membrane-bound organelles are absent. They are also unicellular. 
- Protista and Fungi are eukaryotic, as they have true nuclei, nuclear membranes, and they have membrane-bound organelles. 

### Source of Energy
Organisms can be [[Heterotrophs]] or [[Autotrophs]], depending on how they get their nutrients. 

- [[Viruses]] are parasitical, but are neither autotrophic nor heterotrophic. They use other [[The Cell|cells]] to reproduce, and do not store much [[energy]] themselves. 
- [[Bacteria]] are mostly heterotrophic, but many are also autotrophic. 
- Protists are autotrophic in the form of algae, but are otherwise heterotrophic.
- Fungi are heterotrophic, and get all their nutrients from other organisms. 

## Conditions for replication of Microorganisms
- Sufficient Sustenance
- Moisture
- Optimum temperature
