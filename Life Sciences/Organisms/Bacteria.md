# Bacteria
Bacteria were the first lifeforms to exist on earth. They are [[Classification of Cells|prokaryotes]] that are present in our every day lives. Bacteria can cause diseases, and will partake in [[symbiosis]], but many of them are good for humans. They are also used in multiple fields of biotechnology. ^blurb

## General Characteristics

Bacteria are simple, and unicellular. However, they still have variation in their method of obtaining nutrients. The majority of bacteria are [[Heterotrophs]], but some are [[Autotrophs]]. 

### Autotrophic Bacteria
Cyanobacteria – the bacteria that kick started life on earth – is a photosynthesizing bacteria. Many other early bacteria perform [[Autotrophs#Extra: Non-photosynthesizing Autotrophs|chemosynthesis]]. 

### Heterotrophic Bacteria
The majority of bacteria are [[Heterotrophs]], meaning they receive their nutrients from other species. There are multiple types of heterotrophic bacteria:
- [[symbiosis|Parasitic]] bacteria that obtain food from living organisms
- [[Heterotrophs#^saprotrophs|saphrotrophic]] bacteria that obtain food from dead organisms
- [[symbiosis|Mutualistic]] bacteria that obtain food from living organisms while benefiting the organism

### Reproduction of bacteria
Bacteria reproduce asexually through a method known as *binary fission*. This is very similar to [[mitosis]].

## Structure

![[Bacteria Diagram.jpg]]

Bacteria are always unicellular, and they have no true [[Nucleus]]. This makes them [[Classification of Cells|prokaryotes]]. 

Bacteria have a [[cell membrane]] and a [[cell wall]], and some [[pathogens|pathogenic]] bacteria have a slime layer surrounding it to protect the cytoplasm. Sometimes flagellum can be found, which allow the bacteria to move. 

Within the cytoplasm there are [[ribosomes]], but no membrane bound organelles.

### Shapes of bacteria

- Vibrio – boomerang
- Bacillis – rod
- Coccus – round
- Spirillium – spiral
