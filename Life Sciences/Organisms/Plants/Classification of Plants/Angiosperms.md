# Angiosperms
Plants (The kingdom of angiosperms) can be divided into two separate types of plants: *Monocotyledonous plants* and [[Dicotyledonous plants]]. This is determined by the number of *embryonic leaves* (called cotyledons) found on the plant. These cotyledons appear in the seeds of the plant, as well as during the germination of a plant seed.
