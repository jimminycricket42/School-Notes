# Bryophytes
Bryophytes are a simple group of plants that like cool environments with lots of moisture. They are non-vascular, small plants that require water for fertilization to occur, after which they produce spores. The gametophyte generation is the dominant generation, and is represented by an adult bryophyte plant. ^blurb

| **Plant Type** | **Examples** | **Dominant Generation** | **Structure** | **Vascular Tissue** | **Spores or Seeds** | **Fruit** | **Dependency on water for reproduction** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Bryophyte** | "Liverwort, mosses" | Gametophyte | Thallus - No true roots stems or leaves | Absent | Spores | None | Water needed for Fertilisation |

## Structure
Bryophytes have a thallus plant-body, as it has no true roots, stems, or leaves. Instead, it has leaf-like structures, stem-like structures and rhizoids. The rhizoids anchor the plant and absorb mineral salts and water. 

The sporophyte generation consists of a foot that anchors into the gametophyte. The seta connects to the foot and holds the sporangium which is covered by the calyptra. 

## Reproduction
During the gametophyte generation, the gametes are produced in the male and female reproductive organs, where they then travel through water to fertilize and become a zygote. After a zygote forms the sporophyte generation begins. The sporophyte develops on top of the gametophyte, and is dependent on it for nutrients and water. It produces spores which are distributed by the wind.
