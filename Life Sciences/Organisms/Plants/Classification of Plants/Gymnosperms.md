# Gymnosperms
 Gymnosperms are a group of plants that are adapted to lifo on land. They mostly occur in temperate or cold areas. They have true roots, stems, and leaves, meaning they are complex and vascular. They do not require water for fertilization as they use naked seeds stored in cones. The sporophyte generation is the dominant generation, and is represented by an adult gymnosperm plant. ^blurb

There are 4 types of Gymnosperms:
- **Conifers** – Shrubs and trees, including coniferous trees. 
- **Cycads** – Cone-bearing, palm-like plants.
- **Gnetales** – Only three genera. Low lying, ground plants.
- **Ginkgo** – Only one genus, the *Ginkgo biloba*, called a living fossil.
