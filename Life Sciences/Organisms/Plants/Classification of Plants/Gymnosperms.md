# Gymnosperms
 Gymnosperms are a group of plants that are adapted to lifo on land. They mostly occur in temperate or cold areas. They have true roots, stems, and leaves, meaning they are complex and vascular. They do not require water for fertilization as they use naked seeds stored in cones. The sporophyte generation is the dominant generation, and is represented by an adult gymnosperm plant. ^blurb

There are 4 types of Gymnosperms:
- **Conifers** – Shrubs and trees, including coniferous trees. 
- **Cycads** – Cone-bearing, palm-like plants.
- **Gnetales** – Only three genera. Low lying, ground plants.
- **Ginkgo** – Only one genus, the *Ginkgo biloba*, called a living fossil.

## Structure
Gymnosperms have true roots, stems, and leaves. The roots consist of a large *taproot* system with many lateral roots. The stem is woody and covered in protective *bark*. It has both needle-like green leaves as well as brown scale-leafs. There is well developed *vascular tissue*. 

The seeds are stored in cones, which can be clearly distinguished as male or female. Male cones are smaller and occur in groups, while female cones are larger and fall to the floor. Male cones bear pollen sacks, while female cones bear ovules. Pines have separate male and female spores, which work together in reproduction. 

## Reproduction
Male cones contain the pollen of the plant and the female cones contain the ovules and the sexual organs. Gymnosperms have separate male and female spores that are released after fertilization – Male spores give rise to a male gametophyte, and female spores give rise to a female gametophyte. The pollen grains are released during spring and are carried by the wind. Some pollen grains land on the female cones, where they will be deposited on the ovule. There, they will germinate and develop into the male gametophyte which grows into the female gametophyte. The gametophytes fuse to form a zygote, and fertilization has occured.

The zygote represents he sporophyte generation. It initially develops into the embryo, which becomes a seed. This seed is not enclosed in fruit, so it is a naked seed. The seed will be released when the seed scales open in dry conditions, and the seed will eventually develop into a new sporophyte plant.
