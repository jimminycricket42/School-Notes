### Chlorenchyma
Chlorenchyma are parenchyma that contain [[Plastids|chloroplasts]]. They are exclusively found in the stem and the leaf of the plants.

## Functions of the Parenchyma
- Stores food and water
- [[#Chlorenchyma]] facilitate [[Photosynthesis]]
- Intercellular spaces facilitate [[Gaseous Exchange]]
- The [[Vacuole]] provides rigidity
