## Types of Biodiversity
We look at 3 types of biodiversity:
- Species diversity – variety of species
- Genetic diversity – genetic variety within a species
- Ecosystem diversity – variety of ecosystems in an area

## Types of species relating to biodiversity
There are 3 classifications that are to do with biodiversity:
- **Indigenous** – only occur in one country naturally
- **Endemic** – can only occur in one country and nowhere else in the world
- **Alien** – do not naturally occur in a country but have been brought there and now have a population

## Biodiversity In South Africa
South Africa has the third highest biodiversity in the world. This is because of the land’s unique characteristics. South Africa exists as a plateau in-between two oceans that gives it two sets of prevailing winds that creates savannahs and deserts, as well as subtropical zones that are a host to many indigenous populations.
