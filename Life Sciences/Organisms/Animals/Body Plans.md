# Body Plans
Body plans are a set of morphological characteristics found on an animals body, as well as during it’s development. Body plans are used to [[Taxonomy|classify the phyla]] of [[The Kingdom Animalia|animals]]. ^blurb

There are five common features of an animals body plan:
- [[#Symmetry]] and Cephalisation
- [[#Number of Tissue Layers in the embryo]]
- [[#Presence or absence of a Coelom and a blood system]]
- [[#Number of openings in the digestive tract]]

## Symmetry
Symmetry occurs when you can cut an animal in one or more planes and obtain mirror images. This can be *radial, bilateral, or asymmetrical*. 

### Radial Symmetry
Radially symmetrical animals can be cut in *two or more* vertical planes to create a mirror image. Most of these animals have an *oral* and *aboral* region (towards mouth and away from mouth), but lack a distinct left or right side. They are often *sessile* (non-moving) or free-floating. The have nerve-net that allows it to find food and explore it’s immediate environment for hazards. Their locomotion is often slow and innefficient

### Bilateral Symmetry
Bilaterally symmetrical animals can only be cut in *one* vertical plane to create mirror-images. They have definite sides, namely: Dorsal and ventral, left and right, posterior and anterior. Often a specialized head develops on bilaterally symmetrical animals. This leads to [[#Cephalisation]], and a central nervous system that is very beneficial towards locomotion. 

> [!note] Cephalisation
Cephalisation is the development of a central nervous system in a specialized area (such as the head). Cephalisation allows many forms of movement, such as running, swimming, crawling, burrowing and flying. 


### Asymmetry
Asymmetrical animals show no symmetry, meaning they will never produce mirror images when cut. Sponges are asymmetrical shapes. 

## Number of Tissue Layers in the embryo
The embryo is a mass of cells found in a ball-formation during the development of animals. There are three tissue layers that form, known as *germ layers*. These occur as the endoderm, mesoderm, and the ectoderm. Animals can have two or three germ layers. Animals with two layers are known as *diploblastic*, and only have an endoderm and an ectoderm. The mesoderm of diploblastic animals is replaced by a non-cellular *mesoglea*. Animals with three layers are known is triploblastic. 

All tissues and organs develop from these layers, with specific tissues and organs developing from different layers. 
- Ectoderm – Outer Protective layer, develops the nervous system and sense organs.
- Mesoderm – Internal organs that form [[Structure of the Skeletal System|skeletons]], [[The Circulatory System|blood systems]], reproductive systems and various [[Connective Tissues|connective tissues]]. 
- Endoderm – Forms the lining of the digestive tract

[[#Radial Symmetry|Radially Symmetrical animals]] are diploblastic. They are simpler organisms that develop [[Biological Organisation|tissues]], but do not develop [[Biological Organisation|organs]].

[[#Bilateral Symmetry|Bilaterally Symmetrical animals]] are triploblastic. They can be more advanced, and form both [[Biological Organisation|tissues]] and [[Biological Organisation|organs]].
