# Protista
Protista are a combination of unicellular organisms that do not fall into other kingdoms. They have great diversity, with many forms and common types of organisms. ^blurb

## General Characteristics of Protista
Protista are [[Classification of Cells|eukaryotes]], and are uni- or multi-cellular. They often have primitive levels of cell specialisation, and occur in almost all locations where water occurs. Most protists are aquatic. 

### Reproduction
Protists often reproduce through binary fission, but some have been recorded to reproduce sexually. 

### Grouping of Protista
Protista are grouped into:
- Protozoa
- Algae
- Slime and Water Moulds

#### Protozoa
Protozoa are animal-like heterotrophic organisms. They are unicellular. Amoeba and paramecium are examples of protozoa. 

#### Algae
Algae are plant-like and autotrophic organisms. They can be uni- or multi-cellular. They can be macroscopic, as is the case in algae. They can also be microscopic, a- is euglena or diatoms. 

#### Slime and Water Moulds
Slimes and Moulds are macroscopic and fungus-like. They are heterotrophic.

## Structure of Protists
Protists are uni- or multi-cellular. They have many different structures that can assist in movement, such as pseudopodia in *amoeba*, cilia in *paramecium*, or flagella in *eugelena*. 

Algae have chloroplasts and can photosynthesise. Their cell wall consists of cellulose, except in diatoms where it consists of silica. 

Protozoa ingest their food through [[phagocytosis]]. They do not have cell walls.
