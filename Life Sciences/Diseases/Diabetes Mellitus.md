Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease characterised by high glucose levels in the blood. It is chronic, and incurable, and while there are medicines which relieve symptoms, it is still better to prevent diabetes. ^blurb

Without insulin, the bodies cells receive too little energy to function through [[Cellular Respiration]]. This draws water out of the body cells due to [[Osmosis]], resulting in dehydration and many long-term complications.

- Type two
	- Maintain normal body weight through a diet

## Causes of Diabetes
There are two types of diabetes. Both result in a lack of [[Homeostasis#Hormonal Control of Glucose Concentration in the Blood|insulin]], which stimulates the absorption of glucose from the body into the cells. 

### Diabetes Type 1
Diabetes type one is characterised by the lack of $\beta$ cells in the pancreas, preventing insulin from being released. This can occur when the bodies immune system attacks the body, destroying itâ€™s own $\beta$ cells. 

### Diabetes Type 2
Diabetes type 2 is characterised by a resistance to insulin. This means the body cannot use the insulin effectively, even if it is produced. It is closely linked to obesity, inactivity, and old age.
