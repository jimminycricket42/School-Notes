# Diseases Caused by Microorganisms
[[Microorganisms]] are the cause of many diseases that can be caught and spread rapidly. They can infect cells in many ways, but are commonly transferred through the air or through bodily fluid contact. ^blurb

We look at:
- HIV/AIDS
- Tuberculosis
- Malaria
- Candidiasis/Thrush

## HIV/AIDS
AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, and is caused by the [[Viruses|virus]] HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). This virus attacks [[Lymphocytes#Helper T-cells|CD-4 cells]] which trigger a reaction from the [[Immunity|The Immune System]]. This weakens the immune system, and allows for opportunistic infections to attack the body. HIV transfers through exchange of bodily fluids, such as during sex or through blood. 

### Signs and Symptoms
- Flu Symptoms
	- Sore throat
	- Headache
	- Moderate fever
	- Muscle fatigue and tiredness
- Repeated cold sores
- Skin infections
- Night sweats
- Chronic diarrhoea
- Opportunistic Infections
	- Respiratory infections
		- [[#Tuberculosis]]
	- Neurological conditions 
		- Epilepsy, dyslexia, dementia
	- Cancerous growths

### Management of HIV
A person must undergo blood testing to determine if they are HIV positive. It is important to know your HIV status, especially if you are sexually active with many partners. 

There is currently no cure. When treatment occurs, it is to prevent the replication of HI virus cells, and to keep the CD-4 cells high. This is done by ARV’s (Antiretroviral drugs), Treatment of opportunistic infections, and strengthening the immune system. 

To prevent HIV, education on it’s transmission and safe-sex is important. It is important to have protected sex with a physical barrier between the two participants. Monogamy reduces the chances of catching HIV. Additionally, gloves or another physical barrier must be worn when dealing wit blood to prevent spreading. Needles must not be shared between people. 

Additionally, HIV positive people are extra susceptible to TB, and should be monitored closely. 

## Tuberculosis
Tuberculosis is caused by the [[Bacteria]] *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. TB normally affects the lungs, but can affect any organ of the body. From the lungs it is transmitted aerially through coughing and sneezing infected droplets, that are then inhaled by others, infecting them

### Signs and Symptoms
TB can be active when it overcomes the immune system’s ability to keep it at bay. Otherwise, the body’s immune system has been strong enough to stop it. 

Active TB symptoms include:
- Constant cough
- Tiredness and fatigue
- loss of weight
- night sweats
- chest pain
- coughing up blood or mucous

### Management of TB
TB is an infectious respiratory disease, but it is very curable. A 6-month course of antibiotics may be administered, which will cure the disease. However, if the course is not completed than the bacteria may become resistant to the antibiotic. From there, the government institutes the DOTS programme. This is the Directly Observed Treatment Shortcourse. A healthcare worker or community member ensures that the course is finished.

To prevent TB, education is necessary to ensure that people understand that sunlight, good diet, fresh air and hygienic conditions prevent TB. Healthcare and family must be educated if a family member is infected, and babies are [[Immunity|vaccinated]] against TB until they are adults. 

#### Drug Resistant TB
TB can become drug resistant when a course of medicine is not finished. When TB becomes drug resistant, it is known as MDR-TB (Multi-Drug Resistant TB). Then, a more aggressive antibiotic course is followed. If this is again not completed, TB can become XDR-TB (eXtremely Drug Resistant TB), which is hard to treat and treatments are less effective.

## Malaria
Malaria is caused by the *Plasmodium* protist, which is transmitted by the female *Anopheles* mosquito. When a malaria-infected person is bitten, then the blood is sucked up and affects the mosquito. Then, when biting another person, the protist infects the blood and the process begins again. 

### Signs and Symptoms
Malaria takes approximately 6-14 days to multiply within the liver. Sometimes this takes even longer, and the pathogen avoids detection. The parasite enters the blood and begins to cause:
- Fever
- Headache
- Shivering
- Joint Pain
- Vomiting
- Convulsions
- Anaemia from bursting blood cells
- Brain damage, known as cerebral malaria
- Coma
- Death

### Management
Anti-malarial drugs, such as  Quinine or Artemisinin, are used to treat malaria. However, prevention is the best option to prevent malaria. Preventing the breeding of mosquitoes by reducing stagnant water sources, and preventing them from entering houses using bug shields. Mosquito nets treated with insecticide also prevent mosquitoes from infecting people. 

Prophylactic medication that prevents disease is used for short-term visitors to prevent malaria.

Immunisation can also work as a long-term manner to prevent malaria, but no effective vaccine exists to date.

## Candidiasis/Thrush
Candidiasis is a fungal infection that affects mucous membranes and the skin. It increases in warm, and moist conditions, such as skin folds and vaginas. Bad diets or weakened immune systems also increase candidiasis, as do high stress levels or excessive use of antibiotics. 

### Signs and Symptoms
- Vaginal fungal infection
	- Itching 
	- Burning
	- Irritation
	- Greyish-white discharge
- Oral thrush
	- White spots on the tongue
	- Eating is difficult
	- Pain

### Management
Candidiasis can be treated by increasing hygiene or fixing a diet. Controlling stress levels, or using probiotics will also help greatly.
