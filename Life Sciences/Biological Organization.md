# Biological Organization
Organisms are made up by a series of systems that join together to eventually create an organism. From there we collect organisms into [[#Taxonomical Groups]] ^blurb

These levels are:
1. [[The Cell|Cells]]
2. Tissues
3. Organs
4. Organisms
5. Populations
6. Communities
7. [[Ecosystems]]
8. [[The Biosphere]]

## Cells
Cells are the smallest unit of life. Cells undergo [[Mitosis]] to grow, reproduce and repair damage to [[#Tissues]]. They can perform all functions related to the [[Characteristics of Life]]. Cells are made up of organelles, which individually cannot live, but each one plays an important role in the life of an organism

## Tissues
Tissues are made up of cells that serve common functions. The [[Mammalian Tissues]] are all the tissues that make up mammals, but there are also plant tissues that specialist and grow. 

## Organs
Organs are groups of cells that look similar to eachother and that serve similar functions.

## Organisms
Organisms are the smallest classification that are made up of individual living beings. They consist of many types of creatures, for which the [[Taxonomy|taxonomic system]] was created to categorize them. 

Organisms themselves have more clasifications, such as [[Heterotrophs]] and [[Autotrophs]], as well as [[Microorganisms]].

## Populations 
Populations are groups of the same organism found in an area. 

## Community
Communities are groups of different populations found in an area

## Ecosystems
![[Ecosystems#^blurb]] 

[[Biomes]] classify as large ecosystems. 

## Biosphere 
[[The biosphere]] is the worldwide ecosystem, containing all the plants and animals, as well the [[The Nutrient Cycles]] that sustain all living creatures on earth.
