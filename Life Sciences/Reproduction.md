# Reproduction
**Definition**: The biological process where a new individual or individuals are produced from an already existing individual, where genes are transferred to the next generation. ^definition-reproduction

## Sexual and Asexual reproduction
Reproduction can happen sexually or asexually

**Asexual Reproduction**: One parent is involved and all offspring is genetically identical to the parent. No gametes are involved. ^definition-asexual-reproduction

**Sexual Reproduction**:  Two parents combine their genetic information to create an offspring with a combination of the parents genes. [[Gametes]] are produced through meiosis, which combine during [[fertilization]] ^definition-sexual-reproduction

### Asexual Reproduction
Through [[Mitosis]] or [[Binary Fission]], one organism splits into two. This creates two identical organisms with the exact same genetics. This is common in plants, but less common in animals.

#### Advantages
In favorable conditions, binary fission is fast and produces a large amount of offspring with low energy expenditure. These offspring adapt quickly to the same environmental conditions as the parent because it is genetically identical. 

#### Disadvantages
With very little genetic variation, adaptation to changed or changing environmental conditions is difficult. Additionally, any weak characteristics of the parents will transfer to the offspring. This also makes the organism more susceptible to disease. The fast nature of reproduction can also lead to overpopulation.
