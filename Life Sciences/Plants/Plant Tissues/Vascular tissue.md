# Vascular tissue
Vascular tissue makes up the [[Transport Within Plants|transport systems of a plant]]. It occurs in all [[Plant Organs]], but is organised differently depending on which organ it is found in. ^blurb

We look at:
- Xylem
- Phloem

## Xylem
Xylem is dead tissue that forms drinking-straw-like tubes that uses [[Capillarity]] to move fluids up the stem. Xylem consists of [[#xylem vessels]] and [[#tracheids]]. It is responsible for moving water from the roots of the plant to the tips. ^xylem-blurb

### Xylem Vessels
- Elongated cells connected as a continuous, round tube
- They are dead cells without a cytoplasm
- The [[Cell Wall]] is thickened by lignin in spiral patterns, ring-like patterns, or pitted patterns that provide extra strength to the vessel
	- the pits allow for lateral travel between vessels

### Tracheids
- Elongated cells connected as a round tube with tapered ends
- The tapered ends overlap for strength
- They are dead cells without a cytoplasm
- The [[Cell Wall]] is thickened by lignin in pits that connect to other cells

> [!note]+ :spiral_notepad: Xylem vs Tracheids
> Xylem transports water faster than Tracheids

### Functions of Xylem
- Strengthening of the plant
- [[Transport Within Plants]]

## Phloem
Phloem consists of sieve tubes and companion cells, which transport the products of photosynthesis throughout the plant. ^phloem-blurb

### Sieve Tubes
- Elongated living cells joined together
- The joints between cells contain perforated segments known as sieve plates
- Thin cell walls
- no nucleus â€“ dependant on [[#companion cells]]

### Companion cells
The companion cells have nuclei and perform all the metabolic functions of the sieve tubes.
