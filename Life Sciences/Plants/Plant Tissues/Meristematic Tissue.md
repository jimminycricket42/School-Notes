# Meristematic Tissue
Meristematic tissues are  tissues in which new [[The Cell|cells]] are constantly undergoing [[Mitosis]]. Here the cells have not undergone [[Differentiation]] to fulfill specific functions. Once they have undergone [[Differentiation]], they will form the [[Permanent Tissues]] ^blurb

We look at two types of meristematic tissue:
- Apical Meristem
- Lateral Meristem

## Apical Meristem
The Apical Meristem is found at the tip of the plant stem, where it consists of undifferentiated stem cells. This tissue is what causes the [[Plant Organs]] to grow in *length*.

### Structure of the apical Meristem
- Small, cube-shaped [[The Cell|cells]]
- Thin [[Cell Wall]]
- Large [[Nucleus]]
- No [[Vacuole]]
- No intercellular spaces

## Lateral Meristem
The Lateral Meristem is found in the cambium, where *secondary thickening occurs*. This tissue is what causes secondary growth in [[Dicotyledonous plants#Dicotyledonous Stem|the dicotyledonous stem]].

### Structure of the lateral meristem
- Causes secondary growth
- Replaces damaged cells
