# Epidermis
The epidermis forms a protective layer around the [[Plant Organs]]. ^blurb

## Structure
- Single layer of brick-shaped cells with a protective cuticle
- No [[Plastids|chloroplasts]]
- No intercellular spaces
- Structure can specialise into [[#Root Hairs]] or [[#Guard cells of a stoma]]
- Transparent

### Root Hairs
Root Hairs are specialised cells that have thin hair-like outgrowths. This increases area for absorption of water and minerals. To further promote absorption, root hairs also lack cuticles

### Stomata
Guard cells occur in the leaf of a plant, where they limit water loss. They are bean-shaped cells surrounding an opening surrounding the stoma.

## Functions of the Epidermis
- Protects the underlying plant tissues
- Allows light through for [[Photosynthesis]]
- Cuticle prevents water loss
- Root Hairs absorb water
- Guard cells allow the stoma to open
