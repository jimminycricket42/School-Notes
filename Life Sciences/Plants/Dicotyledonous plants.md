# Dicotyledonous Plants
Dicotyledonous plants have *two cotyledons* as a seed and during germination. As is the case with all angiosperms, we can take a look at: the [[#Dicotyledonous Roots]], and the [[#Dicotyledonous Stem]]

## Dicotyledonous Roots
Dicotyledonous roots have a *tap-root structure*, meaning they have a *mature root* with multiple *lateral roots* extending out of itâ€™s sides. 
### Functions of Dicotyledonous Roots
- *Absorbs* water and mineral salts from the soil
- *Anchors* the plant into the ground. 

### Structure of a Dicotyledonous Root
#### External Structure
![[Dicotyledonous Root.jpeg]]
There are five distinguishable regions on a dicotyledonous root. There is:
- **The Mature region**: the attachment point for lateral roots that allow the plant to anchor itself in the ground. 
- **The Root-Hair region**: Characterised by the existence of unicellular outgrowths with a hair-like appearance. These hairs help increase the surface area for absorption to occur. 
- **The Region of Elongation**: New cells that have been made in the [[Meristematic Tissue|meristematic]] region are elongated. 
- **The Meristematic Region**: New cells are continuously made in this section
- **Root Cap**: Surrounds and protects the root of the plant

#### Internal Structure
The internal structure of the tap-root can be divided into three areas, the [[#Epidermis]], [[#the Cortex]] and [[#the Central Cylinder]]

##### The Epidermis
![[Epidermis]]

In the [[#External Structure|root-hair region]], the epidermis grows root-hairs to increase the area for absorption. 

##### The Cortex
the cortex is a broad layer made up of large, thin-walled *[[parenchyma]] cells* that have large intercellular spaces and help assist with [[Life Sciences/Plants/Transport Within Plants|transpiration pull]]. Between the cortex and [[#The Central Cylinder]] is the endodermis, which is made up of impermeable bands (known as casperian strips) that are waterproof thanks to the substance suberin. This also assists with control of water to the central cylinder during [[Life Sciences/Plants/Transport Within Plants|transpiration pull]].

##### The Central Cylinder
The central cylinder (also known as the Stele) is made up of all the tissues enclosed by [[#The Cortex|the endodermis]]. 
Directly within the endodermis there are multiple layers of pericycle cells. Within the pericycle cells there is [[Vascular tissue|Phloem]] and [[Vascular tissue|Xylem]] cells that assist in [[Life Sciences/Plants/Transport Within Plants|transpiration pull]]. [[Vascular tissue|Xylem]] is arranged in an x-shape within the central cylinder, and the [[Vascular tissue|phloem]] is found between the arms of the x. All other cells found in the central column are known as parenchyma cells. 

### Function of Tissues within the dicotyledonous root
- **Root Hairs** Increase surface area for water absorption
- **[[Epidermis]]** protects the underlying cells
- **[[Parenchyma]]** allows a passage for water and minerals to move to the [[Vascular tissue|xylem]], and work as starch storage
- **Endodermis** Regulates the passage of water to [[#The Central Cylinder]] by means of the waterproof casperian strips
- **Pericycle** form the lateral roots
- **[[Vascular tissue|Xylem]]** transports water and mineral salts up the plant through the [[Life Sciences/Plants/Transport Within Plants|transpiration pull]] effect. They also help strengthen the plant with *lignified* walls
- **[[Vascular tissue|Phloem]]** transports the substances formed in photosynthesis around the plant.

## Dicotyledonous Stem
The Dicotyledonous stem is the parts of the plant that we see above the surface, and is where the plant produces [[Carbohydrates|glucose]] during [[Plastids|photosynthesis]]. 

### Main Functions of the Stem
- Puts the plant in a favourable place to absorb light for [[Plastids|photosynthesis]]
- Puts the flowers in a favourable position for pollination
- Puts fruit in a favorable position for distribution of seeds
- Transports water and mineral salts within the plant, from the roots to the leaves
- Transports organic substances within the plant, from the leaves to the roots
- Stores nutrients and water

### Structure of the Stem
#### External Structure of the Stem
The stem is made up of nodes and internodes. Nodes allow leaves and side-branches to form. The internode is simply the region between nodes. 
Each stem has a terminal bud, which occurs at the end of the stem. The terminal bud has the same [[meristematic tissue]] of [[#Dicotyledonous Roots]], which allow for *primary growth*. Primary growth is upwards growth. 
Axillary buds occur in the spaces (known as axil) between the stem and the leaf stalk (petiole), and can develop into lateral branches and flowers. 

#### Internal Structure of the Stem
The Stem can be divided into three sections while the stem is young: The epidermis, the cortex, and the central column. Later, the structure changes with second growth. 

##### Epidermis
![[Epidermis]]

##### Cortex
The cortex is directly beneath the epidermis, and is made of three sub-layers: the collenchyma, the parenchyma, and the endodermis. 
###### The collenchyma 
The [[collenchyma]] consists of a few cell layers, and assist in supporting the plant with strengthened cell-wall corners. 
###### The Parenchyma
The [[Parenchyma]] is made up of a number of layers with large, thin-walled cells that have large intercellular air spaces. 
###### Endodermis
The endodermis forms the inner layer of the cortex and is made up of brick-shaped cells. It is not very distinguishable, and is even absent in some plant cells. It is sometimes called the starch sheath, because it often stores starch

##### Central Cylinder
The [[Vascular tissue|xylem]] and the [[Vascular tissue|phloem]] occur in *vascular bundles* within the stem. They are arranged in a circle against the *endodermis*, and are arranged a particular way:
- [[Vascular tissue|Xylem]] on the inside
- [[Vascular tissue|Phloem]] on the outside
- Sclerenchyma fibres protect the [[Vascular tissue|phloem]] as the sclerenchyma cap, and is made up of dead cells with even-shapes
- Cambium occurs between the [[Vascular tissue|xylem]] and the [[Vascular tissue|phloem]], and is made up of [[meristematic tissue]], which allows *secondary growth* to occur, and will connect with other vascular bundles to form rings. 
within the central cylinder you find the *pith*, which contains large parenchyma cells with large intercellular spaces and thin cell walls. The parenchyma found between vascular bundles is called the medullary rays. The medullary rays transport substances to the cortex

### Functions of tissues in a dicotyledonous stem
- **Epidermis** protects the underlying cells
- **[[Parenchyma]]** allows a passage for water and minerals to move to the [[Vascular tissue|xylem]], and work as starch storage
- **[[Vascular tissue|Xylem]]** transports water and mineral salts up the plant through the [[Transport Within Plants|transpiration pull]] effect. They also help strengthen the plant with *lignified* walls
- **[[Vascular tissue|Phloem]]** transports the substances formed in photosynthesis around the plant.
- **Endodermis** stores starch
- **cuticle** prevents loss of moisture
- **Stomata** allows gaseous exchange 
- **[[Collenchyma]]** strengthens the stem and keeps it upright
- **[[Parenchyma]]** stores organic substances and help with gaseous exchange
- **[[Sclerenchyma]]** fibres protect the vascular bundles and strengthen the stem
- **Cambium** allows for secondary growth

### Secondary Thickening of the stem
As a plant grows, it does not only grow up. Upwards growth of plants is called primary growth, but secondary growth has to do with the thickening of the stem. Not all dicotyledonous plants undergo secondary growth, but those that do grow large. 

#### How does secondary growth occur
the *cambium* in the [[#Central Cylinder]] of the stem within the vascular bundles is made up of [[meristematic tissue]], meaning it continuously forms new cells. The cambium within the [[vascular tissue]] is called fascicular cambium, and when it starts growing it converts the *medullary rays* into *interfascicular cambium*. These two join up and make an unbroken ring of cambium tissue, allowing the plant to grow evenly. As the tree expands, the existing [[Vascular tissue|phloem]] and the [[Vascular tissue|xylem]] are no longer enough to transport the necessary resources around the plant, so rings of primary and secondary [[Vascular tissue|phloem]] and [[Vascular tissue|xylem]] start to grow, forming the rings you see when a tree is cut. This continues until the tree stops growing. 
In some places the cambium does not form more [[Vascular tissue|xylem]] and [[Vascular tissue|phloem]] rings, but instead allows for more parenchyma cells to form between vascular bundles. This creates larger pith rays that extend from the middle of the stem to the cortex, and allows for the movement of substances in the plant. 

#### Annual rings
As secondary growth repeats within perennial woods, more rings are made. However, in spring this wood is lighter and grows further because the conditions are more favorable for growth. In autumn and winter the wood is darker and the ring is thinner. The age of the tree can be found by counting the number of rings in the wood, and each dark/light band represents a year. 

#### Sapwood and Heartwood
The cambium ring and the [[Vascular tissue|phloem]] are shifted outwards every year, making lighter wood on the outside of the cambium ring. The [[Vascular tissue|xylem]] is the youngest part, and is called the sapwood. The older [[Vascular tissue|xylem]] is blocked by newer [[Vascular tissue|xylem]], and appears darker and thicker. It is known as the heartwood, and gives the tree strength. 

### Formation of cork
Cork is when the outermost layer of the cortex becomes [[Meristematic Tissue|meristematic]] and starts to grow. This forms cork cambium. Cork cambium contains dead cells that are surrounded by thick layers of the waterproof substance *suberin*. This makes the stem impermeable to water and prevents the innermost tissues from drying out. Both the epidermis and the stomata are cut off by the cork, which causes the epidermis to die and flake off, forming part of the bark. The bark is made up of everything outside the cambium ring. In younger plants, gaseous exchange happens in stomata along the stem, but in older plants the stomata can only function when there are gaps in the cork that form small pores on the surface. These pores are known as lenticels. 


## Dicotyledonous Leaf
### Main Function of the Leaf
- Traps sunlight for [[Photosynthesis]]
- Allows for [[Gaseous Exchange]] to occur within the [[Epidermis|stomata]]
- [[Transport Within Plants]] of water and nutrients

### Structure of the Leaf
#### External Structure of the Leaf
![[External Leaf Structure.jpg]]

The external structure consists of:
- The Lamina (leaf blade)
- The Petiole (leaf stalk)
- Veins made of [[Vascular tissue|Xylem]] and [[Vascular tissue|Phloem]]
- The axil, where auxiliary buds will eventually form flowers and lateral branches

#### Internal Structure of the Leaf
![[Internal leaf structure.jpg]]

The internal structure consists of:
- The [[Epidermis]]
- Mesophyll
- [[Vascular tissue|Vascular bundles]]

#### Epidermis
![[Epidermis]]

#### Mesophyll
The mesophyll is made up by the palisade and spongy mesophyll

##### Palisade Mesophyll
The palisade mesophyll cells are made of fibrous [[Parenchyma]] that contain a large amount of [[Plastids|chloroplasts]] right underneath the [[Epidermis]]. They are tightly packed together to maximise the surface area for absorption of sunlight and diffusion of gasses. 

##### Spongy Mesophyll
The spongy mesophyll cells are made of round [[Parenchyma]] that are loosely packed so that there are air spaces for gaseous exchange to occur within the [[Epidermis|stomata]]. They have [[Plastids|chloroplasts]], but they do not produce as much as the [[#Palisade Mesophyll]]. 

#### Vascular bundles
The veins consist of [[Vascular tissue|Xylem]] and [[Vascular tissue|Phloem]] that move water to the [[#Mesophyll]] where it is used for [[Photosynthesis]]. The water exits the xylem through [[Osmosis]], and the [[Vascular tissue|Phloem]] will transfer the [[Organic and Inorganic Compounds|organic compounds]] back to the plant.
