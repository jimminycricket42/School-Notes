# Pteridophytes
Pteridophytes are a group of plants that adapted to life on land. They mostly occur in moist, shady environments. They have true roots, stems, and leaves, meaning they are complex and vascular. They require water for fertilization to occur, and after fertilization they produce spores. The sporophyte generation is the dominant generation, and is represented. ^blurb

## Structure
Pteridophytes have true roots, stems, and leaves with specialized functions and structures. The root is an adventitious rhizome that anchors the plant and absorbs water and mineral salts. From the rhizome grows large, compound leaves known as fronds. They contain vascular tissue, and perform specialized functions.

## Reproduction
Beneath the leaves of pteridophytes are clusters of sporangia. These clusters are known as sori, and they disperse the spores of the plant via the wind. When the spores germinate , it forms into a heart-shaped prothallus. 

The prothallus represents the gametophyte generation. It is short-lived and disappears after one generation of gamete formation and fertilization. They contain the male and female sex organs, as well as rhizoids to anchor it in the soil. 

When wet, sperm travel from the male sex organs to the female sex organs and form a zygote through fertilization. The zygote then develops into a new sporophyte plant that lives parasitically off the gametophyte plant (the prothallus). The prothallus will disappear when the sporophyte is mature.
