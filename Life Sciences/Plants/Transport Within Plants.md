# Transport within plants
We look at:
- the uptake and movement of water and mineral salts within plants
- Movement of water to the [[Vascular tissue|xylem]]
- Upwards movement of water in the [[Vascular tissue|xylem]]
As well as:
- Movement of substances within the plant (Translocation)
- [[Transpiration]] in plants

## Movement of water
### Uptake and movement of water and mineral salts within plants
#### Water
Water is absorbed in the roots of the plant. This happens because of [[Water Potential (Î¨)]]. The soil water contains less solutes than the cell sap in the vacuoles of root hairs. This creates a water potential gradient between the soil water and the cell sap. The semi-permeable cell membrane then allows the water to pass through and [[Osmosis]] occurs, pulling soil water down the concentration gradient into the cell sap. This increases the cell saps water potential, and causes the vacuole to swell and exert turgor pressure. 
#### Mineral Salts
Mineral salts are absorbed against the concentration gradient (From a low concentration in the soil water than in the cell sap). This means it must be an active process, and energy is required. 

### Movement of water to the Xylem
To get to the [[Vascular tissue|xylem]], water again moves down the water potential gradient, away from the [[Dicotyledonous plants#Structure of a Dicotyledonous Root|root hairs]] and towards the [[Dicotyledonous plants#The Cortex|xylem]]. This is because [[Vascular tissue|Xylem]] contain more solutes than root hairs, and therefore have a lower water potential. 
Water can take two paths to get to the [[Vascular tissue|xylem]]:
- osmosis through the parenchyma cells in the cortex
- Diffusion within the air spaces
- between the parenchyma
Diffusion is the faster process here.
The water must them pass through the endodermis, and the casparian strips help assure that all water must undergo osmosis before entering the central cylinder. The water then passes through the pericycle into the [[Vascular tissue|xylem]]. 

### Upwards movement of water in the xylem
There are three forces that move water up the root [[Vascular tissue|xylem]] and into the stem [[Vascular tissue|xylem]] (see [[Dicotyledonous plants#Structure of a Dicotyledonous Root|Structure of a dicotyledonous plant]]). These three forces are:
- Capillarity
- Root pressure
- Transpiration Pull

#### Capillarity
[[Capillarity]] is a phenomenon where liquids will spontaneously move up tubes have a very small bore, such as the [[Vascular tissue|xylem]] vessels and the tracheids of the stem. However, capillarity is a very weak force compared to cohesion and adhesion. Cohesion is the tendency for water to stay together, and adhesion is the force of attraction between the water and the walls of the [[Vascular tissue|xylem]] vessels. This causes the water to move up the [[Vascular tissue|xylem]] vessels in a continuous column.

#### Root Pressure
The roots constantly absorb water. The water moves to the [[Vascular tissue|xylem]], and when the water pools and creates pressure. This is not strong enough to push the water up to the stem, but can move small amounts of water, and assists in creating a pressure gradient.

#### Transpiration Pull
[[Transpiration]] is the main force that pulls water up into the stem. 
![[Transpiration]]
Transpiration causes the water to move down a series of water potential gradients, always from high to low. The pressure gradient is created by the loss of water vapour through the stomata of the leaves. The water diffuses out of the mesophyll walls into the air spaces between the mesophyll cells. That causes a water potential difference, with the mesophyll cell walls having a lower water potential than that of the cell of mesophyll cell-sap, and that potential difference extends back to the [[Vascular tissue|xylem]]. 
This potential difference causes tension to build up and a suction force pulls the water up from the root [[Vascular tissue|xylem]], and the cohesion forces cause the water to be drawn up as a cohesive column. This column is known as the transpiration column. 
This pull reaches all the way back down the [[Vascular tissue|xylem]] vessels, through the root cortex and eventually into the root hairs. 

## Transpiration in Plants
Water and mineral are drawn up the roots to the leaves of the plant by the suction force created by transpiration. Transpiration is also responsible for the evaporation of water from the leaf, which helps cool the plant. 

### Relationship between water loss and the structure of the leaf
#### Size of leaves
The smaller the leaves, the smaller the space evaporation. 
#### Thorns
Thorns can be reduced to thorns, which have fewer stomata and therefore have a lower rate of transpiration
#### Leaf Organisation
Some plants have vertically-arranged leaves that limit the exposed surface area, which helps ensure that the sun does not dry them out in the heat of the day. Additionally, some leaves can cast shade on others, again limiting the exposed surface area. 
#### Position of the stomata
The stomata can be positioned in an area that is less exposed to the sun. 
#### Sunken Stomata
The region outside a sunken stomata traps is saturated with air. This lowers the diffusion gradient and causes moisture to be lost more slowly.
#### Hair on the leaves
Water vapour can be trapped on the epidermal hairs, which lowers the rate of diffusion of water in the air and therefore the rate of transpiration. 
#### Thickened Cuticle
A thicker, waxy cuticle restricts water loss and lowers rate of transpiration. 

### External Factors Influencing Transpiration
#### Temperature
High temperature increases the rate of diffusion of water molecules, meaning more transpiration can occur. 
#### Light Intensity
Stomata open in light and close in darkness. High light intensity also heats up the plant and increases the internal rate of diffusion. 
#### Humidity
When humidity is high, the diffusion gradient is lower and takes place more slowly, lowering the rate of transpiration. 
#### Wind
During transpiration there is an increase of water right outside the plant. Wind removes this layer of water and makes the diffusion gradient steeper, and therefore the transpiration rate increases. 

### Wilting
When a plant loses more water through transpiration than the roots of the plant can absorb, the plant wilts. This is because the decrease in turgor pressure causes the cell wall to lose strength. This is reversed when the plant gets enough water. 

### Guttation
When the humidity is high and the leaf cannot transpire enough, it causes the plant to excrete water droplets through small openings called hydathodes.
