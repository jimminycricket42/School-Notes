# Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis takes place in the [[Plastids|chloroplasts]] in [[Autotrophs]]. It is the process that converts carbon, radiant energy, and water into [[Carbohydrates]]. 

## Formula of Photosynthesis
The formula for photosynthesis is:  

$$
6CO_2 + 6H_2O + \textrm{Radiant Energy} = C_6H_12O_6 + 6O_2
$$

## The Role of Photosynthesis in the Biosphere
In [[The Biosphere]], photosynthesis is responsible for creating many [[Organic and Inorganic Compounds]] that feed and sustain all life on earth. These compounds are namely [[Carbohydrates]] and [[Proteins]], which go through the different [[Energy Flow|trophic levels]] to all organisms. Photosynthesizing plants are called [[Autotrophs]], and are known as [[Energy Flow|producers]]. 

Photosynthesis also contributes to all of the [[The Nutrient Cycles]], as [[The Water Cycle|water]] is used in the reaction, [[The Carbon Cycle|Carbon]] is the main reactant, and [[The Oxygen Cycle|oxygen]] is an important byproduct. 

## Factors that Affect the Rate of Photosynthesis
Photosynthesis is affected by:
- Amount of light
- Carbon Dioxide Supply
- Temperature
- Water supply

### Amount of Light’s Affect On Photosynthesis: Photoperiodism of Plants
Plants need light for Photosynthesis to occur, and different plants need different amounts of light. Most plants thrive in bright light, but others need shady conditions. Too much light can damage the plant tissues. 

Plants have a property called *photoperiodism*, which is the affect of the length of a day on a plant and it’s [[Plastids|photosynthesis]] cycle. We look at 3 different types of photoperiodism:
- *Long-day plants*: photosynthesizes if the day is longer than 12hrs.
- *Short-day plants*: photosynthesizes if the day is shorter than 12hrs .
- *Neutral plants*: photosynthesizes irregardless of the length of the day.

> [!note] Similar Behaviours in Animals
> Some animals also react to the daylight by being more active in the day or more active at night. We call night-active animals *nocturnal animals*, and day-active animals *diurnal animals*. Additionally, There are crepuscular animals that are only active at dusk and at dawn, where temperatures are cool and there is no bright light. 

Some plants will turn to face light, increasing the exposure, while others will wait for the light intensity to drop before they begin Photosynthesis. The difference between these two allow us to decide whether a plant is a *sun-preferring plant* or a *shade-preferring plant*. 

### Carbon Dioxide Supply
Carbon Dioxide is necessary for photosynthesis – therefore it greatly affects the rate of photosynthesis. The level of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere is around 0.04%, meaning that often this is what limits the rate of photosynthesis. However, This has a limit when other factors of  start limiting the rate of photosynthesis, or when the [[Plastids|chloroplasts]] are simply producing as much as they can.

## Temperature’s Affects on Photosynthesis
Temperature increases the rate of photosynthesis in plants as the temperature increases. This is because the process of photosynthesis is a chemical reaction that is accelerated by an increase in temperature to a limit. This is due to the [[Enzymes]] that help increase the rate of photosynthesis
