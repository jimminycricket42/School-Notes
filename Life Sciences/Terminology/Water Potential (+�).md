# Water Potential (Ψ)
#gr10/Q1  #terminology #biochemistry/transport-in-cells 

Water potential is measured in *kilopascals (kPa)*. The *highest possible water potential is 0*, meaning that substance is *pure water*. As more solutes exist in the water, the water potential goes down. For instance, if I dissolved sugar into pure water, my water potential could drop to -150kPa. 
*Water moves from high Ψ to low Ψ* to create an equilibrium. 

### Tonicity
There are three states of tonicity, *Hypertonic, Hypotonic, and isotonic*. These terms *describe how concentrated a solute is* in a solution.
#### hypertonic 
Hypertonic means that there is *high tonicity*. 
#### Hypotonic
Hypotonic means that there is *low tonicity*. 
#### Isotonic
Isotonic means that there is an *equilibrium*.
