# Osmosis
#gr10/Q1 #terminology #biochemistry/transport-in-cells 

**Definition**: Osmosis the the *net movement of water* from an area of high [[Water Potential (Ψ)]] (Ψ) to an area of low water potential *through a semi-permeable membrane* *until a dynamic equilibrium (Ξium) is reached*. 
Osmosis is an *active* form of [[Transport in Cells|transport within the cells]], as it requires energy to move solutes *against the [[Diffusion#^87eabc|diffusion gradient]]*

## Symbols:
Ψ — water potential
Ξium — equilibrium

## Formula:
To calculate equilibrium, average the [[Water Potential (Ψ)]] of the areas you are dealing with. 

$Ξium = \textrm{average water potential of two areas}$
