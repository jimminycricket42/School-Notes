# Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates form the basis of energy within organisms. [[Autotrophs]] produce carbohydrates through [[Photosynthesis]], which is then ingested and processed by [[Heterotrophs]].  ^blurb

## Production of Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are produced by [[Autotrophs]] through [[Photosynthesis]].

## Structure of Carbohydrates
When dealing with carbohydrates, we look at three levels of complexity: Monosaccharides, Disaccharides, and Polysaccharides. These bond together by means of glycosidic bonds

### Monosaccharides
The building blocks of all carbohydrates are *monosaccharides*, meaning small one ring-structures (-saccharide means ring-structure).  are sweet and soluble, and they are all *Isomers*, meaning they have the same molecular structure of C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>. 
There are three types of carbohydrates:
- Glucose ^a93ecb
- Fructose (Fruit sugar)
- Galactose (Milk Sugar)

### Disaccharides
All disaccharides consist of two monosaccharides bound together. They are sweet and soluble, and they are are Isomers on one another with the molecular structure of C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>, as one H<sub>2</sub>O molecule is removed when a bond is formed. This bond is called a *glycocidic bond*. 
There are three disaccharides, and all of them contain glucose and another monosaccharide.
- Glucose + Glucose → Maltose (Malt Sugar)
- Glucose + Fructose → Sucrose (Cane Sugar)
- Glucose + Galactose → Lactose (Milk Sugar)

### Polysaccharides
Polysaccharides are *macromolecules* that consist of thousands of interconnected *monomers*, usually glucose. They are not soluble and not sweet
There are many types of polysaccharides, such as:
- Starch
- Glycogen
- Cellulose ^570345
