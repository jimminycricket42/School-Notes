# Enzymes
Enzymes are a specialized type of [[Proteins|protein]] that *accelerates reactions in the body*. They are known as *biological catalysts*, which means they *speed up reactions in the body* by lowering the activation energy needed for a reaction to take place. They are necessary for life.  ^blurb

They follow what we call the lock and key theory. Enzymes will work until they are *denatured* or *deactivated*

## Lock and Key Theory
![[Enzymes Activation.png]]
The *substrate* fits into the *activation site*, like a key fits into a keyhole. This tells us that the reactions are very specific to the substrate, meaning certain enzymes only affect certain substances. 
Enzymes also work reversibly, meaning they can do both *anabolic* (building-up) and *catabolic* (breaking down) reactions on any substance that fits. This is like a key, that can lock and unlock the door.
Enzymes have an activation site, like a lock has a keyhole
Lastly, enzymes can be *reused*, and they do not wear down with each reaction. This is similar to how locks do not break easily.

### Hydrolysis Reactions
All reactions done by enzymes are hydrolysis reactions, meaning that the anabolic reaction needs water, and the catabolic reaction produces water. 
$$
H₂O + \Box - \bigcirc - \triangle ⇌ \Box \bigcirc \triangle
$$

> the ⇌ sign means that this reaction happens both anabolically and catabolically
#### Example: Glucose and Fructose
The following is the reaction between Glucose and Fructose to form Sucrose and H<sub>2</sub>O. This is performed the the Sucrase Enzyme

$$
\textrm{Glucose} + \textrm{Fructose}⇌ \textrm{Sucrose} + H₂O
$$
## Denatured Enzymes
Enzymes work in very specific environments. They are *pH and temperature specific*, meaning they only work in a range of temperatures and pH’s that are specific to each type of enzyme. 

When an enzyme is denatured, the *shape is lost*, meaning the activation site will no longer fit the substrate, causing permanent damage. 

### Temperature
If the temperature gets *too high, the enzyme will denature* (or stop working permanently). If the temperature is *too low, the enzyme becomes inactive* (stop working until it reaches a more suitable temperature) because there is not enough energy for a reaction to take place.

### pH
Enzymes become denatured when outside of a viable pH. This depends on what *type of enzyme* it is.
