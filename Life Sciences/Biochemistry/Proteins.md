# Proteins
Proteins perform many functions in the body and are made of *amino acids* as their monomers

## Functions of Proteins
Proteins are essential for the structure, growth, maintenance, and repair of cells. They form [[enzymes]], which makes them essential for all cellular reactions. They also perform a structural roll in [[cell membrane|cell membranes]] as *globular proteins*  . Proteins can also act as a reserve store of energy for the body to draw on in extreme circumstances.

## Structure of proteins
Proteins are made up of the [[Monomers|monomer]] *amino acids*. There are 20 different amino acids, but we don’t learn about each one yet. They bond by means of *peptide bonds*. 
Two Amino Acids form a dipeptide $$ \Box - \bigcirc $$
Three Amino Acids form a Tripeptide  $$ \Box - \bigcirc - \triangle$$
More Amino Acids form a Polypeptide $$ \Box - \bigcirc - \triangle - \bigcirc$$
Fifty or more Amino Acids form a Protein $$ \Box - \bigcirc - \triangle - \bigcirc - \triangle - ...$$

> This is the full molecular structure of an amino Acid. The branch to the left (NH₂) is known as an *amine* group, while the branch to the right (COOH) is known as a carbocylic *acid*, and “R” is a *variable* group. The combination of the Amine and the Carbocylic Acid gives us the name “amino acids” while the variable group is what gives us our 20 different types of amino acids.
