# Organic and Inorganic Compounds
We group [[Classification of Matter|compounds]] into two groups: *Organic* and *Inorganic* compounds. ^blurb

## Organic Compounds
Organic compounds have their basis in living organisms. Many of these compounds are produced in [[Autotrophs]] through [[Photosynthesis]], where they then travel up the [[Energy Flow|trophic levels]] and circulate as part of [[The Nutrient Cycles]]

We can classify them based on their contents: if they contain *Hydrogen (H)*, *Oxygen (O)*, and *Carbon (C)* (*must* contain all three), then we can say a [[Classification of Matter|compound]] is organic. They are also  large and complex molecules. 

Common examples are:
- [[Carbohydrates]]
- [[Proteins]]
- [[Lipids]]

## Inorganic Compounds
Inorganic compounds don't have their origin in living organisms. 

We can classify them as *not containing* Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), and Carbon (C) (*does not* contain all three). 

Common examples are:
- Water
- Oxygen
- Carbon Dioxide
- Nitrogen
