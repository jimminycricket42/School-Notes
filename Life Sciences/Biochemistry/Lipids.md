Lipids function as reserve energy for the body, as well as heat insulation. Lipids can be divided into *fats* and *oils*. Fats are defined as being solid at room temperature while oils are defined as being liquid at room temperature. The [[monomers]] of lipids are *fatty acids* and *glycerol*. 

## Differences between fats and oils
### Fats
Fats are generally *saturated*, meaning they *have no* double or triple bonds in their molecular structure. Additionally, they come from *animals*. 

### Oils
Oils are generally *unsaturated*, meaning they *have* double or triple bonds in their molecular structure. Additionally, they come from *plants*. 

## Structure of Lipids
Lipids have long, complicated bonds that we represent quite simply:
