# Fossils
Fossils are preserved records of past organisms. There are a number of [[#Conditions for the Formation of Fossils]] that make them rare, but they are a valuable insight into the [[History of Life on Earth]] ^blurb

> [!note]+ :spiral_notepad: The rarity of fossils
> Fossils require very specific conditions to fossilize. This means that many of thousands of species may have never fossilized, and the fossil record of species is very incomplete.

## The Fossilisation process
1. A Plant or animal dies
2. The dead organism is rapidly buried or placed into anaerobic conditions. 
3. Soft tissues decay, lack of oxygen slows down decay
4. Hard body parts do not decay as it is replaced by other inorganic minerals during *petrification*
5. Layers of [[Sedimentary Rocks|sediment]] cover the organisms and form [[Sedimentary Rocks]]

The fossils can then be pushed up by the formation of [[Rock folding and Faulting#Fold Mountains|fold mountains]].

### Conditions for the Formation of Fossils
1. Organism must die and be thrust into anaerobic conditions 
2. harder parts will be preserved

> [!note]+ :spiral_notepad: Ice and Amber
> Creatures can be almost perfectly preserved in substances such as ice or amber. 


## Types of fossils
### Body Fossils
Body fossils are the remains of organisms where the whole organism or certain parts of it are preserved. Partial body fossils are the most common form of fossils. 

### Mould Fossils
Harder parts of an organism that drop into soft soil and leave a lasting imprint before the organism decomposes.

### Cast Fossils
A cast fossil is when a mould fossil is filled and the materials within harden, forming a cast of the mould. 

### Trace Fossils
Trace fossils are signs of living beings, such as faeces or footprints that were preserved. 

## Fossil Dating 
### Radiometric Dating 
Radiometric dating relies on the decay of radioactive [[Neutrons]] of elements like carbon, potassium, and uranium. The more the element decays, the older it is. Therefore we can date a fossil by measuring the radioactive decay of the element. 

### Relative Dating
