# Secondary Storage
Secondary storage is the permanent, non-volatile storage that keeps the data of a device even after it has been turned off. This is referred to as storage media, and storage media can be fixed or removable. These vary in functions, as well as speed, size, and cost efficiency. ^blurb

## Types of Secondary Storage

### Disk Drives
Disk Drives are permanent, fixed storage. They store all the data and programs of a system. 

#### Mechanical Hard Disk Drives
HDD’s use mechanical components to read/write data onto physical disks. They store the data magnetically within a vacuum sealed casing to ensure that no data is lost or corrupted. 

#### Solid State Drive
SSD’s are entirely electronic, and store data in microchips. This makes them more durable and faster. 

#### Hybrid Drives
Hybrid drives combine HDD and Flash memory. This combines the fast read/write speed of SSD’s with the large capacities of HDD’s 

### Flash Drives
Flash drives store data portably, but are limited to small sizes. They normally connect through [[Motherboard#USB|USB ports]]. 

### Optical Drives
Optical drives use lase light to etch data onto a disk for reading and writing. DVD, CD, and Bluray drives use this technology. Because of the difficulty in changing the data on them, as well as the rise of higher capacity flash drives, optical drives are less popular than they once were.

### SD Cards
Secure Digital cards are flash memory cards that provide large amounts of memory in a small physical footprint. They are often used in portable devices, and can provide upwards of 16GB. 

## Price Comparison of Secondary Storage

| Type         | Size         | Speed           | Cost |
|:------------ |:------------ |:--------------- |:---- |
| Flash        | Up to 1TB    | Up to 10GBps    | 6    |
| HDD - PC     | 1 to 8TB     | 6GBps           | 3    |
| HDD - Laptop | 0.5 to 4TB   | 3 to 6GBps      | 4    |
| SSD          | 120 to 960GB | 500 to 1000MBps | 5    |

## Cloud Storage
Cloud storage is where data is stored remotely and accessed through a wifi connection. This incurs more costs, but can also be cheaper as a short-term solution and allows for flexibility. Often, the capacity of the cloud is simply as much as you buy, meaning that it is more expensive to have more storage. This can go to Terabytes worth of storage. It is also as fast as your [[Communication Media#Microwave Transmissions|WiFi]], which together with the large storage capacities mean that cloud storage does not require expensive systems to use. However, the cost of cloud computing includes renting server space as well as the bandwidth you use.
