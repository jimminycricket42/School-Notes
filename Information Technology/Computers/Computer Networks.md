# Computer Networks
A computer network is a series of devices connected by a communication channel, such as the internet. Each device in a network is called a node, and each connection can be classified as bounded (using wires) or unbounded (over the air). ^blurb

## Servers 
Computer networks are connected through servers, which provide *network security*, *hardware access*, *centralized disk space* or *printer access* to connected nodes. This can be used to create a network of computers that share the same resources, or allow each device on a network to connect to a printer through a router. Additionally, servers can allow multiple routers to act as one network. 

Computer networks that exist in one space are called a *LAN*, or a Local Access Network. Often companies will not setup LAN’s, rather opting to rent server space within a *cloud network*, where the equipment is stored and maintained by another company, and is simply deployed and used by the company who is renting it. This lowers the initial cost of the server deployment, and makes computing accessible to companies. 

## Nodes
Nodes are generally:
- Devices with users, such as personal computers or mobile devices
- Devices that connect nodes together, called switches
- Devices that connect to the internet, such as routers
- Devices that provide a service to a user, such as computers or a server

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Computer Networks
### Advantages
- **File sharing** – saves time copying data and allows access to and collaboration on documents. 
- **Sharing hardware** – such as printers, projectors, storage and more
- **Centralisation** – applications, file storage, and other data such as calendars or contacts can be shared 
- **Productivity** – collaboration and communication are improved by networks

### Disadvantages
- **Security** – more susceptible to unauthorised access
- **Spread of viruses** – rapid spread due to the connections of any computer within the network
- **Cost** – initial cost and maintenance cost may be steep
- **Dependency** – if the central server goes down, then other computers may stop working
