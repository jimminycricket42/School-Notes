# Network Classifications
## Area Networks
We look at:
- LAN: Local Area Network
- MAN: Metropolitan Area Network
- WAN: Wide Area Network
- GAN: Global Area Network
- PAN: Personal Area Network
- HAN: Home Area Network

### LAN: Local Area Networks
Limited to a single building.

## MAN: Metropolitan Area Networks
Multiple [[#LAN: Local Area Networks]] connected within one city.

### WAN: Wide Area Networks
[[#LAN: Local Area Networks]] and [[#MAN: Metropolitan Area Networks]] connected between cities and countries.

### GAN: Global Area Networks
A worldwide [[#WAN: Wide Area Networks]]

### PAN: Personal Area Networks
An individuals interconnected devices where the data is synced or shared. 

### HAN: Home Area Network
All an individuals interconnected devices that are within their home. 

## Home Networks
The home network has a lot of interconnected parts that communicate to allow a user to access the internet

*The Router* joins home networks. This can be wired or wireless. When wired, ethernet lines carry signals. When wireless, the wifi protocol is used. The router connects to an [[Communication Media|ADSL]] or [[Communication Media|Fibre]] line that tranfers data to the wider web. 

A *firewall* protects the home from malicious users. 

## Client-server networks
A client is a way to connect to a more powerful server to share data between computers. 

A server can serve many roles:
- A file server that can store many files for users to access
- A print server that connect many computers to printers
- A web server that can host websites
- An email server that distributes emails to their recipients
- A proxy server that checks incoming traffic for threats

### Local vs Cloud-based servers
Local servers allow a company complete control over their data at the expense of server management costs.

Cloud servers allow access to data cheaply, but with the limitation of an active network connection.
