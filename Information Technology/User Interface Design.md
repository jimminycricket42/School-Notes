# User Interface Design
The user interface is the way that any user will interact with a system. Every user interface needs to allow itâ€™s user to function within the interface, and not be needlessly hindered by it. To do this, a series of guidelines should be followed. ^blurb

These include:
- Readability
- Navigation
- Typography and Color
- Layout
- Theme
- Consistency

## Readability
The number of elements on screen should not be more than needed to perform their function. They should be appropriately spaced to create spaces for tasks and buttons. The fonts and icons used should be recognizable and distinct. They should be visible against the background. 

## Navigation
Any task should be achievable in three or less clicks.

Users should always know where they are on a website, and should be able to get to the homepage from any part of the site. 

## Typography and Color
The fonts of your web page should be readable and available on all browsers. 

Use color associations to guide users decisions, such as red for danger, yellow for warnings, etc. 

## Layout
The sites layout should be a simple, focused layout that brings attention to the content of a page, as well as making the site accessible and useable on any device. 

## Theme
The theme should ensure all pages appear cohesive and have a visual identity that can inform the user of the site being used. 

## Consistency
Elements should have consistent colors and layouts across pages to minimize confusion. Elements that perform the same task should be identical and appear in similar positions across pages. 

Across devices the design principles should be the same, but should be tailored to certain devices.
