# Dates In SQL
Dates have a whole bunch of operators and properties in databases. Using [[SQL]], we can isolate many different parts of a date. This is because dates are an *atomic property* that fixed point in time that can be accessed in many different ways. ^blurb

The many forms of accessing dates in MS Access are:
- YEAR(dateTimeValue)
- MONTH(dateTimeValue)
- DAY(dateTimeValue)
- HOUR(dateTimeValue)
- MINUTE(dateTimeValue)
- SECOND(dateTimeValue)
- NOW()
