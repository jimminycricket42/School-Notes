## Basic services of the internet
We look at:
- Cloud storage
- Email
- Websites

### Cloud storage
Cloud storage is the storage of data online. This is often offered by companies for a fee.

#### Advantages
- No need to buy or maintain equipment
- Access from any internet connection
- automatic remote backup
- only pay for the used storage

#### Disadvantages
- Unreliable internet can disrupt access
- Security concerns because you don’t have direct control of data
- The storage company could close or have an unrecoverable disaster

### Email
Emails are messages sent through an email protocol. To use emails a user acquires and signs into an email address which is linked to a mail server. These email servers use POP or IMAP protocols to allow the retrieval of emails, while the SMTP protocol is used to send emails.

### Websites
Websites are connected documents that may be accessed by a web browser. They are accessed through a domain name that is hosted by a company or individual. 

## Data transmission Protocols
The internet relies on set data transmission protocols to share information between computers. These protocols are:
- TCP – Transmission Control Protocol
- IP – Internet Protocol

TCP sends the data to an IP address that specifies which computer to connect to. A domain name is a pointer to an IP address that is meant to be human-readable. An IP address is a series of numbers stored as bytes.
