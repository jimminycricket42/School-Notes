# Validation Rules 
We look at:
- Length Check
- Presence Check
- Range Check
- Logic Check

We can check these using [[Logical Operators|Boolean Logic]] or [[Logical Operators]]. 

## Length Check
Checks that data is not too long nor too short

> [!example]+ :bulb: Example
>  
>  A password is ten characters long
## Presence Check
Checks that data has been entered into a field or into a variable. 

> [!example]+ :bulb: Example
> 
>  A name cannot be blank
>  
## Range Check
Check that a number is between a certain range

> [!example]+ :bulb: Example 
>  
>  The days spent working in a week cannot be more than seven
>  
## Logic Check
Checks that what is entered is logically correct

> [!example]+ :bulb: Example 
>   
> A distance cannot be negative
