# SQL
SQL is the language used to access [[database|databases]]. It allows us to select data from a source, and manipulate or order that data.  ^blurb


```SQL
SELECT <field>
FROM <table>
ORDER BY <field> DESC /*note: can be ASC or DESC*/
WHERE <condition>;
```
note: the query ends with a ‘;‘

the ‘where’ command can use any comparison, or any [[Logical Operators|Boolean Logic]] operator
