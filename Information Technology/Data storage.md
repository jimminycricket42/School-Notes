# Data storage
A computer has to store data in a machine-readable way. This means that all data must be stored as a combination of *bits*, (binary numbers). This is because of how CPUâ€™s and other computer chips function. ^blurb

## Word Lengths
The [[CPU]] can only handle so much data at once. Working with smaller bits at once leads to inefficiency, and a CPU physically handle working with individual bits. To solve this problem, the concept of word sizes was created. One word consists of many bits that together represent data. The current standard is 64 bits in a word, but it used to be less on less powerful hardware.
