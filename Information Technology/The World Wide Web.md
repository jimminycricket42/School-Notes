# The World Wide Web
The world wide web is a series of interconnected webpages that contain many kinds of multimedia. The world wide web relies on the internet, and while it makes up many of the sites we interact with, there is a lot more than just the world wide web on the internet. ^blurb

The World Wide Web requires:
- Web Pages
- URL’s
- Web browsers
- Search engines

## Web Pages
A web page is essentially a document that is accessible through the web. They can contain any kind of media, such as videos, text, and images.

Web sites are collections of web pages that all connect, often with a homepage that connects them. 

## URL’s 
A URL is a Uniform Resource Locator, and are essentially a route to follow to find [[#Web Pages]]. 

`http://` stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol, the which specifies the the rules that a site must follow as a part of the internet. `https://` shows that a site is verified as secure.

```html
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
```

- `https://` – the transfer protocol
- `www.` – specifies that the resource is a part of the web
- `youtube.com` – the domain name
- `/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ` the path to the resource on the domain host’s server 

## Web browsers
Web browsers allow us to locate and interpret web pages. Their primary function is to display html code. Other features may be provided, such as tabs and bookmarks, but they are not necessary. 

## Search Engines
Search engines are responsible for indexing and retrieving [[#URL’s]] so that a user can access them through a search function.
