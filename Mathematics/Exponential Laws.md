# Exponential Laws
Powers work differently than other numbers. To ensure the correct outcome of calculations involving powers, the exponential laws were created. ^blurb

![[Representation of Powers.jpeg]]

The cases that the laws apply to are:
- The addition and subtraction of powers
- The multiplication and division of powers
- The power of 0
- Exponents applying to brackets with one term
- Exponents applying to brackets with multiple terms
- Exponents applying to brackets containing powers


## The addition and subtraction of exponents
Law: Power with the same base but different exponents cannot add or subtract

$$
x^a \pm x^b \text{…Error}
$$

## The multiplication and division of exponents
Law: Multiplication and division of powers with the same base will cause the exponents to add or subtract

$$
x^a \times x^b = x^{a + b}
$$
$$
\frac{x^a}{x^b} = x^{a - b}
$$

## The power of 0
Law: Any number with the exponent of 0 is equal to one

$$
n^0 = 1
$$

## Powers applying to brackets with one term
Law: Powers applied to brackets will multiply all powers within the bracket

$$
(abc)^d = a^d b^d c^d
$$

$$ (a^b)^c = a^{bc} $$

## Powers applying to brackets with multiple terms
Law: Powers applied to brackets with multiple terms will multiply the entire bracket by itself as many times as the power states. 

This can be simplified with methods such as [[Pascal's Triangle]] or [[FOIL]].

### Foil
$$
(a + b)^2 = (a + b)(a + b) = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
$$
### Pascal’s triangle
$$
(a + b)^3 = (a + b)(a + b)(a + b) = 1 a^3 + 3 a^2 b + 3 a b^2 + 1 b^3
$$

## Powers where the exponent is a fraction
Law: Rational Fraction exponents can be converted into roots. The denominator becomes the root, and the numerator is applied to the base as an exponent

$$ a^\frac{1}{2} = \sqrt{a} $$

$$ a ^\frac{2}{5} = \sqrt[5]{a^2} $$

> Rational exponents can be used to solve sums including surds, as they adhere to the other exponential laws and can therefore be used algebraically to solve for $x$ where surds are involved
