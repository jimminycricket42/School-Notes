# Highest Common Factor (HCF)
The highest common factor is the largest term that two other numbers can divide by and return a whole number. ^blurb

A common factor is a number that two or more numbers can be divided by to return whole numbers. 

> [!example]+ ðŸ’¡ Example: The HCF of 64 and 36
> 
> Lets look at the factors of 64:
> $$ 64 = \begin{Bmatrix} 1 \times 64 \\ 2 \times 32 \\ 4 \times 16 \\ 8 \times 8 \end{Bmatrix}$$
> Now lets look at the factors of 36:
> $$ 36 = \begin{Bmatrix}1 \times 36 \\ 2 \times 18 \\ 3 \times 13 \\ 4 \times 9 \\ 6 \times 6 
 \end{Bmatrix}$$
> There are 2 common factors: 2 and 4
> $$ 2 < 4 \\ \therefore 4 = \textrm{HCF} $$
