# Interest (i)
Interest is the accumulation of value over time. Interest is paid on borrowed money, or on money that is invested. *interest rates* are expressed as percentages, and determine the amount paid in the period agreed upon. This period can be any set amount of time. However, the amount paid each time can change, depending on the type of interest agreed upon. There are 2 types of interest â€“ [[#Simple Interest]] and [[#Compound Interest]]. ^blurb

## Components of Interest
- *Principal amount*: the initial investment/loan that that taken and will grow over time. 
 - *Period*: time in which the investment has grown, or where the loan must be paid off. 
- *Interest rate*: the rate at which interest will grow, and is determined from the type of interest ([[#Simple Interest (SI)]] or [[#Compound Interest (SI)]]). 
- *Accumulated amount*:  the principal amount combined with the interest. 


## Simple Interest (SI)
$$
\begin{flalign}
\\& SI = P \times i \times n

\\& Where:
\\& SI = \textrm{Simple Interest } (R)
\\& P = \textrm{principal } (R)
\\& i = \textrm{interest } (decimal)
\\& n = \textrm{term } (years)
\end{flalign}
$$

### Applications of Simple Interest
- Hire Purchase

## Compound Interest (SI)
$$
\begin{flalign}
\\& CI = (P \times i)^n

\\& Where:
\\& CI = \textrm{Compound Interest } (R)
\\& P = \textrm{principal } (R)
\\& i = \textrm{interest } (decimal)
\\& n = \textrm{term } (years)
\end{flalign}
$$
