# Factorisation
Factorisation is the process of making an equation into a single term. ^blurb

A term is a single mathematical expression which has one output inside of it. Terms are separated by addition of numbers or variables (including the addition of negative numbers). 

## Steps to factorizing:
1. Always take out the *[[Highest Common Factor (HCF)]]* first
	1. check for any common-brackets
	2. Check if you can switch around any terms to match the signs
2. Count the terms
	- if there are *two terms*, look for a difference of squares, or a sum or difference of cubes.
	- if there are *three terms*, look for a Trinomial.
	- if there are *four or more terms*, look for a way to use Grouping.
3. Apply the factorisation method for difference of cubes, trinomial, or grouping. 
4. Repeat until fully factorized

## Factorisation Methods
We look at:
- [[Highest Common Factor (HCF)]] removal
- Difference of squares
- Sum or Difference of cubes
- Trinomial
- Grouping

### HCF Removal
If all terms in an equation share a common factor, we can factorize by removing that common factor through division. To do this we divide all terms within an equation by the common factor. 

> [!example]+ ðŸ’¡ Example: 4x + 2
> 
> lets take 4x + 2 as an example
> $$\begin{gather}
4x + 2 \\
\textrm{HCF of }4 \textrm{ and } 2 = 2 \\
\therefore 2(2x + 1) = 4x + 2
\end{gather} $$

### Difference of squares
When there is a difference of squares, we can factorize by splitting the two squares into their roots. We can prove this works by multiplying the roots through [[FOIL]]. 

> [!example]+ ðŸ’¡ Example 4x^2 - 16
> 
> $$ \begin{gather}
4x^2 - 16 \\
= (\sqrt{4x^2} + \sqrt{16})(\sqrt{4x^2} + \sqrt{16}) \\
= (2x + 4)(2x - 4) â†’
\end{gather} $$

Notice how we split the single term into two terms with opposite signs. If these signs were the same, our [[FOIL|bracket multiplication]] would result in 3 terms instead of 2. This is because square numbers are part of [[Quadratic Equations]], which have two real roots. 

### Sum or Difference of cubes
Cubes can be factorized by putting them into two separate roots â€“ a binomial and a trinomial. This can be proven through [[polynomial division]], but is easier to do using a standard form. 

$$\begin{gather}a^3 \pm b^3 = (a \pm b) (a^2 \pm ab + b^2)\\
\textrm{if } a^3 + b^3 \textrm { then: } 
a^3 + b^3 = (a + b) (a^2 - ab + b^2)\\
\textrm{if } a^3 - b^3 \textrm { then: } 
a^3 - b^3 = (a - b) (a^2 + ab + b^2)\\
\end{gather}$$

> [!example]+ ðŸ’¡ Example: 8x^3 - 27
> 
> $$\begin{gather}
a^3 - b^3 = (a - b) (a^2 + ab + b^2)\\
8x^3 - 27 = (2x + 3) (4x^2 - 6x + 9^2)
\end{gather}$$

### Trinomial
Trinomials can be factorized by applying the principles of [[FOIL]], but in reverse to create an expression where [[FOIL|bracket multiplication]] creates a trinomial. 

$$ ax^2 + bx + c $$
If we look at this equation, we want to get what common factors of â€˜aâ€™ and â€˜câ€™ will add to create â€˜bâ€™. 

lets fill in â€˜aâ€™ â€˜bâ€™ and â€˜câ€™ to make this simpler. 

$$ 6x^2 + 17x + 12 $$
factors of the coefficient of x<sup>2</sup> and the constant term:
$$ \begin{gather} 
6 = \begin{Bmatrix} 
1 \times 6 \\ 
2 \times 3 
\end{Bmatrix} \\
12 = \begin{Bmatrix}
1 \times 12  \\
2 \times 6  \\
3 \times 4 
\end{Bmatrix}
\end{gather} $$

Now we can look and see which factors, when multiplied and added, will give us the coefficient of x. 

$$ \begin{gather} 
6 = \begin{Bmatrix} 
1 \times 6 \\ 
\mathbf{{\color{blue}2} \times {\color{red}3}}
\end{Bmatrix} \\
12 = \begin{Bmatrix}
1 \times 12  \\
2 \times 6  \\
\mathbf{{\color{red}3} \times {\color{blue}4}}
\end{Bmatrix} \\
\therefore({\color{blue}2} \times {\color{blue}4}) + ({\color{red}3} \times {\color{red}3}) = 8 + 9 = 17 â†’
\end{gather}$$

now we know what factors of  the coefficient of x<sup>2</sup> and the constant term will give us 17 when multiplied and added. Now we can put them into a factorized sum:
$$ ({\color{blue}2}x + {\color{red}3})({\color{red}3}x + {\color{blue}4})
$$
Note how the factors are cross-multiplied, but in the final factorisation they are not crossed anymore. 

> [!example]+ ðŸ’¡ Example: 12x<sup>2</sup> - 56x +9
> 
> $$\begin{gather} 
12x^2 - 56x + 9 \\
\textrm{Factors of 12 and 9:} \\
12; 9 = 
\begin{Bmatrix} 1 \times 12 \\ {\color{red} 2} \times {\color{blue} 6} \\ 3 \times 4 \end{Bmatrix}
;
\begin{Bmatrix} {\color{red} 1} \times {\color{blue} 9}  \\ 3 \times 3  \end{Bmatrix} \\
{\color {red} 2 \times 1} + {\color {blue} 6 \times 9} = 56\\
\therefore {\color {red} 2 \times -1} + {\color {blue} 6 \times -9} = -56 \\
\therefore 12x^2 - 56x + 9 = ({\color {red} 2}x -{\color {blue} 9})({\color {blue} 6}x - {\color {red} 2})
\end{gather}$$

### Grouping
Grouping is the most uncommon form of factorisation, because often it does not simplify into a single term, rather creating less terms that can be factorised further using other methods. 

$$ 4a - 4b + ad - bd $$

notice how we have 4 terms, but b<sup>2</sup> and c<sup>2</sup> only appear in two of them? This means we will likely have to employ grouping â€“ especially considering there are no current common factors, differences of squares, trinomials, or cubes. This means we must break up the sum in a way that will get us one of the other methods to simplify with. 

$$ \begin{gather} 4(a-b) + d(a-b) \\ = (a-b)(4+d) \end{gather} $$

Initially, there were no common factors between each term. Through grouping we created a common factor that could then be used to further factorize.
