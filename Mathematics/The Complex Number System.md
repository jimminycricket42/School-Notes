# The Complex Number System
A complex number is a number that reaches outside of the real plane of numbers. It is denoted by the symbol ![[Complex Number I.png]] ^blurb
 
The standard form for complex number is: $$ z = a + bi \textrm{ where } a,b \in \mathbb{R} \textrm{ and } i = \sqrt{-1}$$
## Where does “i” come from?
$$
\begin{flalign}
\\ & x^2 + 1 = 0
\\ & x^2 = -1
\\ & x = ±\sqrt{-1}
\\ & x = ±i
\end{flalign}
$$
## Pattern of “i”
$$
\begin{gather}
\\ & i^1 = \sqrt{1} 
\\ & i^2 = -1
\\ & i^3 = -i
\\ & i^4 = 1
\\ & \textrm{this pattern repeats every 4 terms, where each term is a single step of } i^n
\end{gather}
$$

## Graphing ‘i’
we can graph ‘i = a + bi’ the same way that we graph vectors, with a representing our horizontal (or real) plane and bi representing our vertical (or imaginary plane). This is called an *argand* diagram
$$
\mathbb{z} = 3 -2i
$$
## Operations in the Complex Numbery System
### Addition
$$ \begin{flalign}
& \textrm{if } \mathbb{z}1 = 3 - 2i \textrm{ and } \mathbb{z}_2 = 2 + 3i 
\\& \mathbb{z}_1 + \mathbb{z}_2 = (3 - 2i) + (2 + 3i)
\\& = (3 + 2) + (-2i + 3i) \textrm{ ... group alike terms}
\\& = 5 + i 
\end{flalign}$$
From this we can determine that the complex number system is closed in addition, meaning that the end result will never leave the complex number system when addition is performed.

### Subtraction
$$ 
\begin{flalign}

& \textrm{if } \mathbb{z}1 = 3 - 2i \textrm{ and } \mathbb{z}_2 = 2 + 3i 
\\& \mathbb{z}_1 - \mathbb{z}_2 = (3 - 2i) - (2 + 3i)
\\& = (3 - 2) + (-2i -3i) \textrm{ ... group alike terms}
\\& = 1 - 5i 

\end{flalign}
$$

From this we can determine that the complex number system is closed in subtraction, meaning that the end result will never leave the complex number system when subtraction is performed.

### Multiplication
$$ 
\begin{flalign}

& \textrm{if } \mathbb{z}1 = 3 + 2i \textrm{ and } \mathbb{z}_2 = 2 + 3i 
\\& \mathbb{z}_1 \times \mathbb{z}_2 = (3 - 2i) \times (2 + 3i)
\\& = (3 \times 2) + (-2i \times 3i) \textrm{ ... group alike terms}
\\& = 6 + 6i 

\end{flalign}
