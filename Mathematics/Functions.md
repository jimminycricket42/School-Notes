# Functions
Functions are a way of creating reuseable maths sums. They essentially allow us to take an expression and use it without having to write it out each time. Function notation looks like: $f(x) = x \pm n$ where $\pm n$ is really any expression. ^blurb



In $f(x) = x \pm n$, if a value is put in the place of $x$ in $f(x)$, then that same value will appear in the expression attached to $f(x)$.

> \\& f(2) + g(3)
> \\& = (2(2) + 4) + (\frac{(3)^2}{3}) && \textrm{...substitute in x} 
> \\& = 8 + 3 && \textrm{...simplify both}
> \\&\therefore f(2) + g(3)= 11
