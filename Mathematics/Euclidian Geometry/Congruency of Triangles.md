# Congruency of Triangles
Congruence means two things are the exact same. See [[Similar Triangles]] for triangles with the same angles but differing sides

## Cases
- SSS – Side Side Side – all sides of △A are equal to sides of △B
- SAS – Side Angle Side – two sides of △A next to the angle are equal to two sides of △B next to an equal angle
- RHS – Right angle, Hypotenuse, Side – the Hypotenuse and one side are equal and the triangles have right angles
- SAA – corresponding Side, Angle, Angle – two angles along one equal side
